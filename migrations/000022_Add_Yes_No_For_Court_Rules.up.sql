(4) Where the Court makes an order under sub-rule (1), it may order the action to be stayed or dismissed, as may be just, and may make an order providing for the costs of the application and the proceedings accordingly. (5) Where the Court makes an order under sub-rule (2), it may make an order giving judgment in such terms as it considers just, and may make an order providing for the costs of the application and the proceedings accordingly. 29.
