Reasonable suspicion may be based on hearsay evidence provided to the Garda if it provides reasonable grounds for suspicion and the Garda actually believes it.3 The Garda training manual states that a Garda can only act on the basis of hearsay evidence when forming a reasonable suspicion if he or she has taken steps to satisfy him or herself of its probable truth. DPP Keogh [1998] 4 416 is authority for the proposition that, where the prosecution has to prove the existence of a reasonable suspicion on the part of the arresting garda, that garda is not entitled to adduce evidence of the previous character and activities of the accused as part of his testimony in chief. Offences Against the State Amendment Act 1998) The section confers a number of powers, including the power of arrest, on members of An Garda Siochana in relation to offences under any section of the Act and offences scheduled under the Act (commonly referred to as ''Scheduled Offences'').'),

Neither statute nor common law provide for a definition of what amounts to "reasonable force". What is reasonable will depend on the individual circumstances under which the arrest is taking place, including the offence for which the person is being arrested for.

Any search should comply with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights which contains the prohibition against inhumane and degrading treatment and Article 8 (privacy considerations). DPP Fagan [1994] 3 265 establishes that a garda has a common law power to stop drivers of cars of whom he has no suspicion provided that he acts bona fide and does not do so in a capricious or arbitrary manner. This case was followed by Clark in DPP Farrell [2009] 4 689. However, in the absence of consent or a valid warrant, persons can only be detained and searched prior to arrest if there is a statutory power to do so. The legal authority and reason for the search must be communicated to a suspect before any search is carried out.11 Examples of statutes which confer such powers are: * Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 allows a member of An Garda Siochana to ''stop...'),

It had been suggested, obiter, in Gormley that a right of reasonable access to legal advice encompassed the right to have a solicitor present during questioning.

From time to time necessity demands that some unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases ''necessity'' is the operative test''. The right to bail was further defined by O''Higgins C.J. in In the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill 1975 [1977] 129 at 154: ''What is termed a right to bail is not a constitutional right but a recognition by the courts that a person presumed to be innocent shall not have his liberty interfered with unnecessarily pending his trial on a criminal charge.'),

Under section of the Bail Act 1997 (as inserted by the Criminal Justice Act 2017), in ruling on an application for bail, the court must give reasons for the grant or refusal of the application. Objections under O''Callaghan: that the defendant will evade justice if admitted to bail In the Supreme Court decision of DPP Ryan [1989] ILRM 333 Finlay stated that: ''the established reasons for the refusal of bail all come within the broad category of preventing the evasion of justice, either by the accused absconding; by the accused interfering with witnesses; or by the accused destroying, concealing or otherwise interfering with physical evidence'' To show this belief other relevant factors listed in O''Callaghan can be utilised i.e. previous record, sentence to be imposed on conviction, evidence to support the charge etc. The Supreme Court held in O''Callaghan that where bail is opposed on the grounds that an accused person will interfere with the course of justice or that he will interfere with witnesses if he is allowed bail, the Court must be satisfied by sufficient evidence on such matters before it refuses bail.

An Objection under Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 1997 and a refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a further "serious offence" by the applicant for bail. In an effort to undo the effects of the Supreme Court''s interpretation in O''Callaghan of the constitutional issues with regard to the right to bail, a referendum was held in 1996 which resulted in the addition of the following article to the constitution: "Article 40.4.7 Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person." This paved the way for the enactment of the Bail Act 1997 which permits the courts to refuse bail where a person is charged with a serious offence in order to prevent the commission of further offences by the applicant. Section 1 of the 1997 Act defines "serious offence" as follows: "serious offence" means an offence specified in the Schedule for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of 5 years or by a more severe penalty.'),

If the hearsay evidence is to be admitted what weight should be given to it by the court? A number of Supreme decisions are relevant in considering this issue: McKeon DPP (Unrep., Supreme Court, October 12, 1995) Here the Supreme Court upheld the admissibility of hearsay evidence to support the opinion of a Garda that bail should be revoked because the Defendant was preparing to leave the country with assistance from an illegal organisation. The information upon which the opinion was based came from a confidential informant. The police privilege in relation to confidential information was considered to be sufficient reason to justify admitting the hearsay evidence.

The previous proceedings can be established by a copy of the record certified by the appropriate officer of the court. The dispute usually centres on the interpretation of the earlier proceedings and whether or not they are sufficiently similar to amount to an autrefois bar. The Criminal Procedure Act 2010 erodes the principle of double jeopardy to permit the following three retrial procedures: administration of justice. An offence against the administration of justice includes corruption, witness intimidation or jury tampering. The DPP may make only one such application and a re-trial must be in the public interest. Section 23, as amended by section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2021, provides the DPP with a "with prejudice" right of appeal against acquittals following trial on indictment.

Sections 8 and 9 of the 2010 Act are not retrospective. This contrasts with the position in England and Wales where the 2003 Act is retrospective. A plea of Not Guilty must be entered by the defendant. It cannot be offered on his/her behalf by Counsel. The effect of a not guilty plea is that the whole prosecution case is put in issue before a jury. Where a plea of guilty is accepted the prosecution is released from its obligation to prove the case and there is no need to empanel a jury. The Court may proceed straight to the sentencing process after having heard an outline of the facts of the case. This outline is normally presented by the Garda in charge of the case.

The first consideration is the common law rule that before an item of evidence can be admitted in criminal proceedings it must be relevant to issues in the proceedings. Dealing with the issue of relevant evidence, Fennelly stated in People (DPP) Ferris (Unreported, CCA, June 10 2002): "This means evidence which tends to prove or disprove whether the accused committed the act with which he is charged." The relevance or irrelevance of direct evidence of facts in issue in proceedings will generally be readily apparent. However the determination of the relevance of circumstantial evidence can prove more difficult. Circumstantial evidence is any fact from the existence of which the judge or jury may infer the existence or non-existence of a fact in issue. A classic example of such evidence is the testimony of a witness at a trial for murder that he saw the accused carrying a blood-stained knife at the door of the house in which the deceased was found mortally wounded.'),

Another example of an exclusionary rule is the common law rule against the admission of non-expert opinion. Another is the common law rule that a confession must be excluded if it is found to have been made involuntarily: see State Treanor [1924] 2 obtained evidence will be considered later in this chapter. In addition to individual exclusionary rules, a trial judge has a general discretion to exclude relevant evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This is a long established common law principle. An illustration of the operation of this principle arose in People O''Neill [1964] Jur. Rep.1. At the trial of an accused convicted of manslaughter arising out of a car accident, evidence was adduced that he had been in a pub on the evening of the accident and had consumed alcohol.

Issues around admissibility of evidence will often be determined through legal argument. However, some issues will turn on matters of fact as, for example, where a defendant challenges the admission of his or her confession on the grounds that it is involuntary or was obtained in breach of his or her constitutional rights. Where this is the case, the procedure in a jury trial is for the trial judge to conduct a "trial within a trial" in the absence of the jury, also known as a voir dire. During the voir dire, witnesses will be called by the party seeking to adduce the disputed evidence in an effort to justify its admissibility.

A less stringent rule operates in relation to evidence obtained improperly or in breach of legal rights only, which can be admitted or excluded at the discretion of the trial judge based on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances. Evidence is obtained illegally where, for example, it is obtained by a person acting without or beyond his lawful authority or if it is obtained by the commission of a crime.

The prosecution could not say whether the prints were taken with or without consent. Other issues that arose included the fact that no prosecution had flowed from the taking of the original prints and whether the prints should have been destroyed with the passage of time. On appeal from the decision of Charleton in the High Court, the key question for the Supreme Court was whether the "O''Brien" exclusionary rule (which was still in existence at the time) should cover facts which gave rise to a suspicion grounding an arrest, rather than simply facts being offered as part of the evidence at a criminal trial.'),

In English law the distinction is important because in Funderburk 90, it was held that if it is not "relative to the subject matter of the indictment or proceeding" then the section does not apply and the situation is governed by common law. Under common law if a witness'' testimony is inconsistent with a previous statement made by him, that statement may be put to him in to challenge his credibility if the inconsistency will affect his likely standing with the jury. However, if in the witness denies the matter, under the common law rule of finality of answers to collateral questions, the cross-examining party cannot prove the making of the statement. This means that you can them, but that you have to leave it at that if they deny the matter. (i.e. Can suggest to Snooks that earlier he said "shreddies", 88 [1998] Crim.

Under the Irish legal system it is always a judge or, in the case of the Special Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal, a panel of judges, who impose sentence. In jury trials, in the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court, the jury''s one and only role is to decide issues of fact - the ultimate fact being: is the person guilty or not guilty. Once that is decided, they have no further role to play. All matters that involve sentencing - including weighing up the gravity of the offence, the impact on the victim and the personal circumstances of the accused - are matters for the judge and for the judge only. Mandatory sentences are rare in Irish law. Where a particular offence carries a mandatory sentence, the judge must impose that sentence and has no discretion in the matter.'),

No statute permits a maximum penalty of more than 12 months for an offence on conviction in the District Court.

The trial judge noted the early plea but felt that this was "devalued" because the applicant had been "caught redhanded".
