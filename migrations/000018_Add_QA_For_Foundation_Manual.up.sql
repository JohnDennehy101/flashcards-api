PECUNIARY AND NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES Some compensatory damages are relatively easy to assess. For instance, if a plaintiff has an accident and has to pay €40 for a hospital visit, that plaintiff will be entitled to damages in the sum of €40. However, other damages are more difficult to assess. By way of example, if a plaintiff breaks a leg or suffers from depression as a result of an accident, how are the courts to compensate that?

The most significant restriction in this regard is the doctrine of remoteness. In theory, a chain of causation can run and run, exposing the tortfeasor to ever more liability. The doctrine of remoteness effectively imposes a cut-off point in this chain of causation, beyond which the tortfeasor will not be responsible for the injury or loss caused by his or her tortious actions. The principles of this doctrine of remoteness are more a matter of substantive tort law rather than the law of damages, but the most basic ones will be set out here. THE GENERAL TEST OF REASONABLE FORESEEABILITY A person is always liable for consequences which he or she intends to cause. However, (for most torts) a person is not liable for consequences which he or she did not intend, unless it was reasonably foreseeable that consequences of that type would ensue. The courts are particularly cautious in relation to psychological injury and economic loss and so in considering what is reasonably foreseeable in relation to either of these types of loss you should refer to the textbooks and cases dealing with the substantive tort law on these areas. THE EGG-SHELL SKULL RULE The egg-shell skull rule limits the application of reasonable foreseeability principles with regard to physical and psychological injury.'),

The most significant restriction in this regard is the doctrine of remoteness. In theory, a chain of causation can run and run, exposing the tortfeasor to ever more liability. The doctrine of remoteness effectively imposes a cut-off point in this chain of causation, beyond which the tortfeasor will not be responsible for the injury or loss caused by his or her tortious actions. The principles of this doctrine of remoteness are more a matter of substantive tort law rather than the law of damages, but the most basic ones will be set out here.

The award of damages should compensate the plaintiff for these losses. There are two types of pecuniary losses: expenses and loss of pecuniary benefits. For instance, a person who breaks her leg may have to pay for a hospital visit (an expense) and may miss time from work (loss of earning). There are also different types of non-pecuniary losses: past and future pain and suffering; past and future loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation of life. SPECIAL AND GENERAL DAMAGES Special damages represent the plaintiff''s actual pecuniary loss between the date of the injury and the date of trial. These can be quantified precisely and must be specifically pleaded. General damages are more difficult to quantify and comprise future pecuniary loss as well as past and future non-pecuniary loss. Unlike special damages, general damages are not costed individually in the pleadings (see further the chapters on drafting pleadings in the Civil Manual). RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PECUNIARY AND NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES In O''Leary O''Connell [1968] 149, the Supreme Court held that it was best practice to award damages separately under various heads of damages.

As well as equitable injunctions, you should be aware of a number of statutory injunctions, particularly in the planning and environmental codes. DAMAGES IN LIEU OF AN INJUNCTION In all cases where equitable principles establish that an injunction could be granted, damages will be awarded in lieu of an injunction if (a) the injury to the plaintiff''s legal rights is small; it is capable of being estimated in money; it can be adequately compensated by a small money payment; it would be oppressive to the defendant to grant an injunction TYPES OF INJUNCTION There are numerous different types of injunction. You should be aware of the following terms: * Prohibitory injunction: restrains the performance or continuance of a wrongful act; * Quia Timet ["because he fears"] injunction: restrains the performance of a threatened wrongful act - can be granted before any wrongful act occurs, but special principles apply. * Mandatory injunction: requires the performance of an act; * Interim injunction: this is obtained for a limited period, possibly on an parte basis, and usually applies only until the next motion day, when the other side has an opportunity of putting their case; * Interlocutory injunction: this will have effect until the final hearing of the action takes place.'),

However, some goods are so rare that damages would not be an adequate remedy; an order of specific performance might be granted in such a case. Generally, damages are an adequate remedy in the case of a contract to pay money. However, specific performance may be ordered where the contract is for the payment of a periodic amount or for the payment of a sum to a third party.

However, things are not always so simple. Suppose an Argentine on holiday in Ireland is run down by a Spaniard driving a German-built car, the brakes of which were faulty. Where should the victim sue? What law should the court apply? If the victim sues in Ireland and is successful, how can he or she enforce her judgment against the Spanish driver and the German car manufacturers? Private international law, also referred to as conflicts of law, provides answers to these questions. It resolves the conflict between laws of different countries. This is a hugely complex subject. Yet with increasing internationalisation, it is a subject which is of ever increasing relevance for legal practitioners. The purpose of this chapter is to give a brief overview of the most important principles of the subject and to outline the legislation which, to a certain extent, is replacing the old common law. PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW IS A NATIONAL LAW SUBJECT Contrary to what its name might suggest, private international law is a matter of national law. That is, each state has confronted the sort of situations outlined in the first paragraph above and has attempted to evolve rules which are both practicable and fair. It follows that each state has its own private international law. The differences between different legal systems can be quite marked.'),

Case The case established that where proceedings are brought first in one Member State, all other Member State courts must stay any proceedings involving the same parties and same cause of action pending the first seized court''s decision on jurisdiction. This is so even when those proceedings have been brought in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of another Member State court and irrespective of the amount of time that the jurisdictional issues will take to resolve (in this respect, some courts take much longer than others). This ruling encouraged ''torpedo'' actions whereby proceedings are (wrongly) commenced in one Member State court to delay any proceedings in the chosen court.
