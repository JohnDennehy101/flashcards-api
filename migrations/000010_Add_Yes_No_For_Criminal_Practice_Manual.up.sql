To effect an arrest under warrant, the arresting officer must have secured prior permission from the appropriate authority. The most common form of such a warrant is a "bench" warrant issued by a judge when a defendant who has entered into a recognisance (or promise) to appear in court has failed to appear in court. Most arrests, however, are effected without warrant (which is also known as summary arrest). The powers of arrest without warrant are identified below. Common law powers of arrest have largely been superseded by statute. However, the common law power of summary arrest for the common law offence of breach of the peace remains. Both a citizen and a member of Garda Siochana enjoy a common law power of arrest for breach of the peace. Either may arrest a person who has committed or is committing such an offence in their presence or someone who they reasonably believe is going to commit a breach of the peace in the immediate future.

Reasonable suspicion may be based on hearsay evidence provided to the Garda if it provides reasonable grounds for suspicion and the Garda actually believes it.3 The Garda training manual states that a Garda can only act on the basis of hearsay evidence when forming a reasonable suspicion if he or she has taken steps to satisfy him or herself of its probable truth. DPP Keogh [1998] 4 416 is authority for the proposition that, where the prosecution has to prove the existence of a reasonable suspicion on the part of the arresting garda, that garda is not entitled to adduce evidence of the previous character and activities of the accused as part of his testimony in chief.

Neither statute nor common law provide for a definition of what amounts to "reasonable force". What is reasonable will depend on the individual circumstances under which the arrest is taking place, including the offence for which the person is being arrested for. There must be a reasonable proportion between the amount of force used and the offence in question8 and only moderate and proportional force will be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights9. On arrest a person must be conveyed to a garda station with reasonable dispatch10 although detention occurring during a temporary delay before the suspect is conveyed to a garda station may be permissible if for a "reasonable" period of time.

Any search should comply with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights which contains the prohibition against inhumane and degrading treatment and Article 8 (privacy considerations). DPP Fagan [1994] 3 265 establishes that a garda has a common law power to stop drivers of cars of whom he has no suspicion provided that he acts bona fide and does not do so in a capricious or arbitrary manner. This case was followed by Clark in DPP Farrell [2009] 4 689. However, in the absence of consent or a valid warrant, persons can only be detained and searched prior to arrest if there is a statutory power to do so. The legal authority and reason for the search must be communicated to a suspect before any search is carried out.11 Examples of statutes which confer such powers are: * Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 allows a member of An Garda Siochana to ''stop...'),

In order to effect the search the gardai may detain the person for a reasonable period, even though they have not been arrested12 but if incriminating objects are found on the person the garda is obliged to either release the person or to arrest, charge and to take the person into custody. Article 40(5) of the Constitution provides that: "Every citizen''s home is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in due accordance with the law." A dwelling therefore enjoys a special constitutional protection which other premises do not. A Garda may enter private premises with the consent of the occupier but in such circumstances, must leave when asked to do so unless they have effected an arrest in the premises (in which case it is permissible to search the immediate vicinity pursuant to the common law power to search an arrested person and his or her immediate vicinity - see 3. below).'),

From time to time necessity demands that some unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases ''necessity'' is the operative test''. The right to bail was further defined by O''Higgins C.J. in In the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill 1975 [1977] 129 at 154: ''What is termed a right to bail is not a constitutional right but a recognition by the courts that a person presumed to be innocent shall not have his liberty interfered with unnecessarily pending his trial on a criminal charge.'),

An Objection under Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 1997 and a refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a further "serious offence" by the applicant for bail. In an effort to undo the effects of the Supreme Court''s interpretation in O''Callaghan of the constitutional issues with regard to the right to bail, a referendum was held in 1996 which resulted in the addition of the following article to the constitution: "Article 40.4.7 Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person." This paved the way for the enactment of the Bail Act 1997 which permits the courts to refuse bail where a person is charged with a serious offence in order to prevent the commission of further offences by the applicant. Section 1 of the 1997 Act defines "serious offence" as follows: "serious offence" means an offence specified in the Schedule for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of 5 years or by a more severe penalty.'),

Examination Of Defence Witnesses This follows the same format as before, save that the roles are reversed. The defence will not necessarily call any witnesses, in which case the defence will go straight to their closing submission (see below). If there is more than one defendant, the first defendant will call their first witness. The prosecution will then have an opportunity to cross-examine, followed by the legal representative/s of the co-defendant. There will then be an opportunity for re-examination. This procedure is followed for each of the first defendant''s witnesses (including the defendant him/herself if he/she is giving evidence). Once the first defendant has called all their witnesses, the second defendant will then call each of their witnesses in the same way. Closing Submission by Defence When all the evidence has been heard, the defence will apply to have the case dismissed/ a verdict of not guilty passed against their client.

Although, in Kelly, the Supreme Court was not dealing specifically with the case of appeals from the District Court, it is submitted that the reasoning adopted would be equally applicable with respect to appeals from the District Court. An application to extend time must be made on notice to the other side and cannot be made parte (State (O''Sullivan) Buckley). order is suspended pending appeal, meaning he may not drive pending the hearing of the appeal. If he had taken up an appeal within 14 days of the original order, all aspects of the order, including the disqualification from driving, would have been suspended pending the hearing of the appeal.

The onus of proof is on the defendant who must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The previous proceedings can be established by a copy of the record certified by the appropriate officer of the court. The dispute usually centres on the interpretation of the earlier proceedings and whether or not they are sufficiently similar to amount to an autrefois bar. The Criminal Procedure Act 2010 erodes the principle of double jeopardy to permit the following three retrial procedures: administration of justice.

This is to ensure that the defendants receive consistent sentences. On occasion a defendant may plead guilty, but in mitigation advance an explanation which amounts to a defence and therefore in effect a plea of not guilty.

Another example where it is important that the jury be carefully addressed on the burden of proof is when the issue of the presumption that the accused intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions arises in a murder case. The jury must be directed that this presumption will apply unless it is rebutted.

The first consideration is the common law rule that before an item of evidence can be admitted in criminal proceedings it must be relevant to issues in the proceedings. Dealing with the issue of relevant evidence, Fennelly stated in People (DPP) Ferris (Unreported, CCA, June 10 2002): "This means evidence which tends to prove or disprove whether the accused committed the act with which he is charged." The relevance or irrelevance of direct evidence of facts in issue in proceedings will generally be readily apparent. However the determination of the relevance of circumstantial evidence can prove more difficult. Circumstantial evidence is any fact from the existence of which the judge or jury may infer the existence or non-existence of a fact in issue. A classic example of such evidence is the testimony of a witness at a trial for murder that he saw the accused carrying a blood-stained knife at the door of the house in which the deceased was found mortally wounded.'),

A number of these rules are covered elsewhere in the manual e.g. the rule against hearsay (Chapters 23 and 24) and the rule against the admission of misconduct evidence (Chapter 29). Another example of an exclusionary rule is the common law rule against the admission of non-expert opinion. Another is the common law rule that a confession must be excluded if it is found to have been made involuntarily: see State Treanor [1924] 2 obtained evidence will be considered later in this chapter. In addition to individual exclusionary rules, a trial judge has a general discretion to exclude relevant evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This is a long established common law principle. An illustration of the operation of this principle arose in People O''Neill [1964] Jur. Rep.1. At the trial of an accused convicted of manslaughter arising out of a car accident, evidence was adduced that he had been in a pub on the evening of the accident and had consumed alcohol.

The onus of establishing that evidence is relevant and that it does not fall foul of any of the exclusionary rules rests on the party that wishes to adduce the evidence. Issues around admissibility of evidence will often be determined through legal argument. However, some issues will turn on matters of fact as, for example, where a defendant challenges the admission of his or her confession on the grounds that it is involuntary or was obtained in breach of his or her constitutional rights. Where this is the case, the procedure in a jury trial is for the trial judge to conduct a "trial within a trial" in the absence of the jury, also known as a voir dire. During the voir dire, witnesses will be called by the party seeking to adduce the disputed evidence in an effort to justify its admissibility. The usual rules around examination-in-chief and cross-examination will apply and the other side may call witnesses if desired. Having heard the evidence, the trial judge will then rule on the issue.

A less stringent rule operates in relation to evidence obtained improperly or in breach of legal rights only, which can be admitted or excluded at the discretion of the trial judge based on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances. Evidence is obtained illegally where, for example, it is obtained by a person acting without or beyond his lawful authority or if it is obtained by the commission of a crime. In DPP McMahon [1987] ILRM 87, Finlay stated that where an unlawful or improper act was committed when obtaining evidence, but no constitutional right of the accused was deliberately and consciously breached, the evidence "shall be admissible unless the court in its discretion excludes it".

Statements of contemporaneous physical sensation experienced by a person are admissible as evidence of the existence of that sensation, if it is in issue or relevant to an issue, but not as evidence of its possible causes.

While sentencing usually means the person has been convicted of an offence, this is not a necessary pre-requisite. For example, section 1(1), Probation of Offenders Act 1907 might be applied, finding that the facts alleged against a person have been proven, without entering a formal conviction. Under the Irish legal system it is always a judge or, in the case of the Special Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal, a panel of judges, who impose sentence. In jury trials, in the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court, the jury''s one and only role is to decide issues of fact - the ultimate fact being: is the person guilty or not guilty. Once that is decided, they have no further role to play. All matters that involve sentencing - including weighing up the gravity of the offence, the impact on the victim and the personal circumstances of the accused - are matters for the judge and for the judge only.

They can be divided into three broad categories: Primary Options, Secondary Options and Specific Jurisdictions. The main sentencing options open to a judge are: The maximum sentence of imprisonment for a summary offence is set out in the statute creating the offence. No statute permits a maximum penalty of more than 12 months for an offence on conviction in the District Court. Were a statute to set a higher penalty it would be vulnerable to challenge as being unconstitutional in that summary offences are minor offences and an offence carrying a sentence of over 12 months cannot be regarded as a minor offence (see Mallon Minister for Agriculture 161).

Most statutes will specify the maximum term of imprisonment which a court can impose on a person found guilty of a particular offence. So for example, if a person is found guilty on indictment of violent disorder, section 15 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 provides that they can be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence provided for in statute is a key reference point for any sentencing judge. It will provide a good indication as to how serious an offence is. Generally, if an offence attracts a maximum sentence of more than 5 years, it will be considered a "serious offence". One consequence arising is that a person can be arrested and detained without a warrant for offences with a prison sentence of 5 years or more.

Otherwise, prisoners would be able to commit offences in prison without fear of additional punishment.

An offender who is repeatedly released on bail and commits further offences may therefore find themselves with a very lengthy cumulative sentence.

He or she can do this by adjusting the individual sentences downwards if consecutively they would lead to a sentence which would be unjust in the circumstances of the case.

While such a sentence cannot exceed the maximum sentence for the offence charged in relation to which a sentence is actually imposed, it should reflect the other offences which have been taken into consideration.

The "taking offences into consideration" mechanism cannot operate in cases where statute imposes mandatory penalties, and a court cannot take into consideration an offence over which it has no jurisdiction. Therefore, the District Court could not, for example take into consideration a murder when sentencing someone for a minor road traffic violation, per Henchy in DPP Gray 167. Usually, a sentence will start running on the day on which it is imposed. There is however no statutory provision regulating when sentences begin. It is a matter for the discretion of the judge. It is common practice for a court to back-date a sentence to start on the date that the person first went into custody.

Therefore, a sentencing judge in most cases has a large amount of discretion in imposing sentence. This discretion should, however, be exercised reasonably. For this purpose, there are long standing sentencing principles which a judge should have regard to and which should guide him.

These are the sentencing principles which have been accepted by the Irish courts. Additionally, the notion of preventative justice has found mixed acceptance. The balancing of these aims is not necessarily easy. One aim will often have to give way to another, considered more important in the circumstances. So, for example, the desire to rehabilitate a drug addict who has robbed an old lady, may result in him receiving a sentence lesser than "the just deserts" which retributive justice might demand.

It is therefore the duty of the courts to pass what are the appropriate sentences in each case having regard to the particular circumstances of that case - not only in regard to the particular crime but in regard to the particular criminal."212 Courts will have regard to the fact that the offender is a drug addict, particularly if it is dealing with offences that can be linked to the addiction - e.g. theft in order to get money to feed the habit.
