Where the Plaintiff fails to comply with such a request, it is open to the court to stay the proceedings; to dismiss the Plaintiff''s action; to take the failure into account in deciding whether to award costs at the end of the proceedings; and to draw such inferences as appear proper. The procedure for such an application is set out in Order 1A Rule 12 (as substituted by 229 of 2024). The procedure under section 11 does not replace the existing rules whereby a party make seek further and better particulars of claim from his opponent. See Armstrong Moffatt & Anor. [2013] 1 417.'),

DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM The form of defence and counterclaim required by the Act can also be found in the Rules. Where a Defendant wishes to make a counterclaim against the Plaintiff, authorisation must first be sought from PIAB. In personal injuries proceedings a Defence and a Counterclaim are separate documents. Order 19, Rule 15 of the Rules of the Superior Courts states that the Defendant or Plaintiff (as the case may be) must raise by his pleading all matters which show the action or counterclaim not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence or reply, as the case may be, as if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings, as, for instance, fraud, Statute of Limitations, absence of authorisation by the Personal Injuries Resolution Board, release, payment, performance, facts showing illegality either by statute or common law, or Statute of Frauds.'),

The Defendant and any third party must also swear such an affidavit verifying allegations or assertions pleaded by them. Where there is a failure to lodge a verifying affidavit within the time required, the court hearing the personal injuries action concerned shall (a) draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper, and where the interests of justice so require make no order as to the payment of costs to the party responsible for the failure, or deduct such amount from the costs that would, but for this subsection, be payable to the party responsible for the failure as it considers appropriate. The form of the verifying affidavit is contained in the Rules of Court and Practice Directions. The affidavit may be endorsed on the pleading itself, (thus unnecessary to repeat the heading and title of the proceedings) in which case it shall be delivered within the time prescribed by the Rules for delivery of such pleading or other document. Where the verifying affidavit is a separate document, such affidavits must be lodged in court not later than 21 days after the service of the pleading concerned.

Order 1A, Rule 11(4) states that where the copy of the affidavit of verification is delivered subsequent to delivery of the pleading or other document, the time prescribed by these Rules for delivery of any pleading or other document in reply shall run from the date of delivery of such copy. MEDIATION Section 15 of the 2004 Act allows the court, on the request of either party, to direct the parties to attend a mediation conference. In default of agreement by the parties, the chairman of the mediation conference may be appointed by the court. Section 16 of the Act provides that his report, stating the outcome of the conference, will be furnished to the court. A party failing to comply with a direction to attend a mediation conference may suffer a costs penalty. FORMAL OFFERS Section 17 of the 2004 Act requires the parties to offer each other formal terms of settlement.'),

The terms of the offer are not communicated to the trial judge until after judgment has been delivered. The court may then take into account, in awarding the costs of the proceedings, the terms of the offers and the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties in making their formal offers. In a personal injuries action relating to catastrophic injury, the formal offer shall specify the proportion of the amount of the formal offer that is attributable to (a) the future medical treatment of the plaintiff, the future care of the plaintiff, the provision of assistive technology or other aids and appliances associated with the medical treatment and care of the plaintiff, and future loss of earnings of the plaintiff. RBA SCHEME In relation to payment of compensation to an injured person under the Recovery of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme, a compensator is obliged to pay to the Minister for Social Protection the amount of any recoverable benefits before making any compensation payment. The benefits covered under the RBA scheme are: illness benefit, partial capacity benefit, injury benefit, incapacity supplement, invalidity pension and disability allowance.'),

PERIODIC PAYMENT ORDER (PPO) The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 makes provision for an award of damages by way of a periodic payments order in certain circumstances where a plaintiff has suffered catastrophic injuries. "Catastrophic injury" is defined in the Act as: "...in relation to a person, a personal injury which is of such severity that it results in a permanent disability to the person requiring the person to receive life-long care and assistance in all activities of daily living or a substantial part thereof;.." The relevant provisions are contained within Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the 2017 Act and they came into operation on October 2018. The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023 (Part 3) amends the Civil Liability Act 1961 to provide for the setting of the indexation rate for periodic payment orders by Ministerial regulations. This allows the amount of a periodic payment order to be adjusted annually by reference to an index for different goods and services, in order to reflect the rate of inflation, including wage inflation, in Ireland.'),

Section 26 of the Act requires the court to dismiss any personal injuries action in which the Plaintiff gives or causes to be given false or misleading evidence or swears a false or misleading affidavit. Nolan O''Neill [2016] IECA 298 (para 43): to be successful the Defendant must establish an intention on the part of the Plaintiff to mislead the court and that they caused evidence to be adduced which did mislead the court. COSTS The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2007 introduced two amendments to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, in relation to costs, namely: (a) Section 51A 3(a): where a claimant rejects a PIAB assessment that has been accepted by a respondent and where they fail in any subsequent proceedings to obtain more damages than the amount determined by the PIAB assessment, no award of costs can be made in favour of the Plaintiff against the Defendant.'),

Note that while the contents of each of the pleadings are essentially the same for each court, the structure/layout and some terminology varies (e.g. in the High Court and Circuit Court the Personal Injuries Summons includes an Indorsement of Claim, in the District Court it is a Statement of Claim etc). Note: Clinical/medical negligence claims - Personal Injuries Pleadings are currently required.

THE CLEAN BREAK PRINCIPLE It has been clearly acknowledged by the Irish Courts that the concept of a "clean break" is not part of Irish family law. However, in recent years, the courts have recognised the benefits of finality, save in the most exceptional cases. This is particularly evident in ample resource cases, where significant assets/payments have been made to a party either in the course of a separation agreement, judicial separation or divorce. In such cases, although a party is not precluded from applying to the court for further ancillary relief, an application for additional financial relief is less likely to be successful. All orders are ancillary to a decree and can only be made if a decree has been granted. They cannot be made if a decree is refused, as these orders do not stand alone.'),

A separation agreement is a contract between the parties to live separate and apart and to regulate their legal rights. Parties may enter into mediation for the purpose of assisting them in agreeing its terms. The separation agreement is subject to the law of contract and practitioners should ensure that each party receives independent legal advice prior to executing the agreement as it is voidable in instances of duress, undue influence and fraud. Although parties may in the alternative elect to regulate their affairs by obtaining a decree of judicial separation or divorce, where they fulfill the criteria set out in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, parties who do not come within these criteria, but whose relationship is acrimonious, may have no alternative but to enter into a separation agreement.

The Regulation establishes a mechanism allowing for a direct recognition of Protection Orders issued as a civil law measure between Member States.

The Istanbul Convention is broad in scope in so far as its purpose is to prevent and/or eliminate all violence, including domestic violence, which affects women disproportionately.

The vast majority of applications for Barring Orders or Safety Orders are made in the District Court. A small number of applications are made in the Circuit Court in the context of Judicial Separation or Divorce proceedings. A stand-alone application can also be made in the Circuit Court by way of a Domestic Violence Civil Bill.

Secondly, Counsel must assess whether an applicant can potentially satisfy the test for relief under the Act. CATEGORY OF PERSONS ENTITLED TO APPLY FOR RELIEF UNDER THE ACT The category of persons entitled to apply for reliefs under the 2018 Act are considered later in this chapter. An application by a person not entitled to apply under the 2018 Act will more than likely be struck out following an application by the respondent''s Counsel or at the Court''s own instigation. BASIC TEST FOR RELIEF UNDER THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT 2018 There is no definition of "domestic violence" under the 2018 Act. Applications under the 2018 Act are premised on satisfying the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety and welfare of the applicant or dependent person require an order to be made. Section 2(1) of the Domestic Violence 2018, Act defines "welfare" as including "the physical and psychological welfare of the person in question".

Currently, under Irish law victims of crime can apply for compensation under the criminal compensation scheme. The scheme pays compensation for expenses and losses suffered as a direct result of a violent crime or while assisting or trying to assist in preventing a crime or saving a human life. However, the scheme is not available if the victim and the assailant were living together as part of the same household when the injury was sustained. It appears therefore that the criminal compensation scheme must be reviewed to ensure Ireland meets its obligations under the Convention. Matters to be Considered in Determining Custody, Access of Children Art 31, Chapter 5 also requires that Parties legislate to ensure that in the determination of custody and visitation rights of children incidents of violence covered by the scope of this Convention are taken into account.

Forced Marriages Art 32 of Chapter 5 requires that Parties take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that marriages concluded under force may be voidable, annulled or dissolved without undue financial or administrative burden placed on the victim. Currently under common law forced marriages can be annulled. The Domestic Violence Act 2018 makes it an offence to force any person to enter into a marriage (Section 38).

Recently the Domestic Violence Act 2018 legislated to create specific offences of psychological violence, stalking and forced marriage. Aggravating Circumstances In addition, Chapter 5 of the Convention requires signatories to legislate so that the following is considered aggravating circumstances in the determination of sentences for offences under the Convention: (a) the offence was committed against a former or current spouse or partner as recognised by internal law, by a member of the family, a person cohabiting with the victim or a person having abused her or his authority; the offence, or related offences, were committed repeatedly; the offence was committed against a person made vulnerable by particular circumstances; the offence was committed against or in the presence of a child the offence was committed by two or more people acting together; the offence was preceded or accompanied by extreme levels of violence; the offence was committed with the use or threat of a weapon; the offence resulted in severe physical or psychological harm for the victim; the perpetrator had previously been convicted of offences of a similar nature.'),

Signatories are required to establish jurisdiction over any offence established in accordance with this Convention, when the offence is committed: (a) in their territory; or on board a ship flying their flag; or on board an aircraft registered under their laws; or by one of their nationals; or by a person who has her or his habitual residence in their territory. The Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction) Act 2019 gives effect to the requirements set out in Article 44. This piece of legislation was commenced in the day of April, 2019.

This Chapter also requires the State to provide for granting of protection orders. This is also provided for in Section 10 of the 2018 Act. Article 55, Chapter 6 requires signatories to ensure that investigations into or prosecution of offences established in accordance with Articles 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 are not wholly dependent upon a report by a victim if the offence was committed in whole or in part on its territory, and that the proceedings may continue even if the victim withdraws her or his statement or complaint. Currently under Irish law prosecution of offences are not dependent upon a report of a victim nor must proceedings be discontinued if the victim withdraws his/her statement of complaint.

Stafford Rice at paragraph 23 (1)-(14): [emphasis added] The terms of Order 28 and the authorities on it suggest the following: (1) The power of amendment is a broad one.

(2) In principle, any claim, cause of action or defence that could have been pleaded initio can be added by way of amendment, even if that has the effect of materially - even radically - altering the nature and/or scope of the existing proceedings: see (inter alia) Wolfe Wolfe [2001] 1 313, per Herbert at 135; Shell & Ireland Ltd McGrath [2006] IEHC 99, [2006] 2 ILRM 299, per Laffoy at 311 and Rossmore Properties Limited , at para 19.6.'),

Again, that is evident from its express terms, providing as it does that "[a]ll such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties" (my emphasis). (4) The requirement that the amendment is necessary for the purpose of determining "the real questions in controversy between the parties" - the language used in Order 28, Rule 1 - "simply means that the amendment must raise or relate to an issue between the parties arising from the subject matter of the proceedings": Delany & McGrath on Civil Procedure 2018) (para 5-200).

(6) Where a party seeks to rely on prejudice as a basis for resisting an amendment, they must be able to identify some prejudice that stems "from the fact of the belated alteration in the pleadings rather than the presence (if allowed) of the amendment itself" (per Clarke in Woori Bank and Hanvit LSP Finance Ltd KDB Ireland Limited [2006] IEHC 156, para 3.2) (7) Prejudice can arise in different ways. It may be substantive, in the sense that, by virtue of the fact that the amended plea was not made in the proceedings as originally constituted, the other party is or may be disadvantaged in answering that plea.

Where the effect of allowing an amendment would be to significantly disrupt the management and determination of proceedings, that will weigh - and in some circumstances may weigh decisively - against allowing the amendment. Historically, it may have been thought that this form of prejudice can be adequately addressed by the making of an appropriate order for costs. However, as Clarke observed in Woori Bank, contemporary ideas of appropriate case management and the increasing emphasis on the need for the efficient use of court resources suggest that this form of prejudice "may loom large in the considerations of the court" (at para 4.2).

It is on that basis that a court hearing a joinder application will normally leave any limitation issue over for later determination and it is only where the limitation issue is so clear that joinder would be "futile" that joinder should be refused: see the discussion in my judgment in Cawley Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council [2021] IECA 266] where a new claim is added by way of amendment of existing proceedings pursuant to Order 28, that claim is deemed to have been made from the date of the commencement of the proceedings: Mangan Murphy [2006] IEHC 317, at pages 4-5.

It is not necessary for a defendant to establish as a matter of probability that the new claim is statute-barred: a real possibility that the claim is barred will suffice: see, e.g., Mangan Murphy at page 6 (it is "clear that there is a possibility that allowing the amendment would cause prejudice to the defendants by excluding them from reliance upon the Statute of Limitations") and Smyth Tunney [2009] IESC 5, [2009] 3 322, per Finnegan at para 30 (the "Statute of Limitations may well have run and the defendants would be prejudiced by the amendments sought as to additional publication") (11) However, that rule is not an absolute one and ought not to be applied overly rigidly.

In such circumstances - neatly illustrated by the facts of Krops permitting a new claim to be made by way of amendment causes no material prejudice to the defendant because they are already on notice of a claim(s) arising from the same facts, which they will have had an opportunity to investigate. The new claim cannot therefore be characterised as a "stale claim" or one which unfairly re-opens a past transaction(s) which the defendant might otherwise have legitimately regarded as closed. (12) There is some suggestion in the authorities that the power of the High Court under Order 28 to permit an amendment "on such terms as may be just" would allow the court to permit a new claim to be added by way of amendment expressly on terms that the amendment will take effect only from the date of the amendment order. The judgment of Birmingham in Rossmore Properties Limited can be read as indicating that he intended that the order made by him in that case should have that effect.

Furthermore, the summons is required to be in one of the standard forms set out in Appendix Part III (RSC) or, if none of those forms is applicable, in a similarly concise form. As there is to be no Statement of Claim care must be taken to ensure that the special indorsement of claim is properly and sufficiently set out and refers to all facts and matters necessary to make out the claim (see generally Bond Holton [1959] 117 124). For example, in a claim by a bank for payment of an overdraft (which is an on-demand facility) the special indorsement of claim must not only identify the facility and state the correct amount outstanding but also that demand had been made for repayment and that the sum remains outstanding. It should also be noted that pleading the bare facts essential to prove the claim are themselves not always enough. The claim must give sufficiently precise particulars to enable the Defendant to decide whether he ought to pay or resist the claim.

The court may take into consideration other exceptional factors which may exist in a particular case. In order to obtain an interlocutory injunction the applicant must (save in the most exceptional cases) give a "cross undertaking in damages".

The court cannot compel an applicant to give an undertaking but it can refuse to grant an injunction unless he does. (2) The undertaking, though described as an undertaking as to damages, does not found any cause of action.

It is important to underline the fact that the question whether the undertaking should be enforced is a separate question from the question whether the injunction should be discharged or continued. (6) In many cases injunctions will remain in being until the trial and in such cases the propriety of its original grant and the question of the enforcement of the undertaking will not be considered before the conclusion of the trial. Even then, as Lloyd L.J. pointed out in Financiera Avenida Shiblaq, The Times, 14 January 1991; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No. 973 of 1990 the court may occasionally wish to postpone the question of enforcement to a later date.

O''Donnell went on to consider the interaction of the adequacy of damages and the balance of convenience, setting out eight factors which might be considered by a court in determining whether to grant an injunction in such a case.

As this Court said in Betty Martin Financial Services EBS [2019] IECA 327 (at para. 34) allowing that establishing a serious issue to be tried is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to the grant of an injunction at least where that issue, if established at trial, would provide a basis for a permanent injunction, the decision to grant or refuse thereafter becomes a matter of overall assessment of where the balance of justice lies, though with particular (and, in many cases, decisive) weight being given to the adequacy of damages within that overall assessment.'),

It is essential that the mandatory order is framed precisely so that the respondent knows exactly what is required of him. This requirement is more than purely a matter of form and if the order sought by the applicant is imprecise the court may refuse to grant the order. Thus, in Bula Ltd Tara Mines Limited (No. 2) [1987] 95 the court declined to make the order sought because the judge determined that the obligation was insufficiently certain to enable the respondents to understand their obligations and to enable the court to determine whether or not they were complying. In this context it is worthy of note that the maxim "equity does nothing in vain" applies.

This, by necessity, requires an examination of the applicant''s case. It will be recalled that in Campus Oil the Supreme Court stated that such an examination should not be conducted. In Campus Oil the court did, however, go on to state that an interlocutory order granting mandatory relief would only be granted in exceptional cases. However, this apparent contradiction is resolved, mandatory orders will generally only be granted in clear cases. On an application for mandatory relief, Fennelly stated in the case of Maha Lingham Health Service Executive [2006] ELR 137: ...in substance what the plaintiff/appellant is seeking is a mandatory interlocutory injunction and it is well established that the ordinary test of a fair case to be tried is not sufficient to meet the first leg of the test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction where the injunction sought is in fact mandatory.

However, some examples are illustrative of the fact that that such refinements and variations can be seen as a response to the need to minimise the risk of injustice in the context of the particular types of issues which are likely to arise in special cases. [76] A first example may be found in relation to mandatory interlocutory orders. As Megarry observed in Shepherd Homes Ltd. Sandham [1971] 340, at 351:"In a normal case the court must, inter alia, feel a high degree of assurance that at the trial it will appear that the injunction was rightly granted; and this is a higher standard than is required for a prohibitory injunction."

Where, for example, the substance of the order sought in those cases involves something which, in substance, is a mandatory order (as to which see Bergin Galway Clinic Doughiska Ltd [2007] IEHC 386, [2008] 2 I.R. 205 and Giblin Irish Life And Permanent P.L.C.

[77] Second, it may well be that there is a category of case where the court has to take into significant account the fact that the grant or refusal of an interlocutory order may go a long way towards resolving the case itself: See N.W.L.

It is, therefore, hardly surprising that, in such cases, where the result of the interlocutory application will either completely, or significantly, decide the case, the courts have felt it necessary to impose a higher standard before an injunction can be granted (normally the Maha Lingam standard). That variation from the pure Campus Oil test can be seen as nonetheless still coming within the general principle of attempting to fashion an order which runs the least risk of injustice for if the grant or refusal of an interlocutory order will go a long way towards deciding the case then the risk of an injustice is even greater and the court requires a greater degree of assurance before intervening.

Such orders may be obtained either prior to trial or after trial prior to any judgment obtained being executed. Mareva injunctions are by their nature interlocutory and because they are used most commonly where there is a threat of removal or dissipation, the application is almost always made parte with a fixed return date at which the respondent may argue for discharge or variation. The freezing of assets is, on any analysis, a draconian step and the courts are therefore careful to ensure that such an order is granted only in an appropriate case and on appropriate terms. The return date for the inter partes hearing is invariably short to enable the respondent to put speedily his side of the case either with regard to discharge or, commonly, variation of the terms. Unlike normal injunctions where final injunctive relief is sought at trial a Mareva order is in essence ancillary to the relief being sought, namely the satisfaction of a judgment against the respondent.

Not only will such failure possibly lead to discharge, but it may in any event render the applicant liable to the respondent on the cross-undertaking in damages and liable to pay the costs. RISK OF REMOVAL OR DISSIPATION The court will only grant a Mareva order where it is established that there is a real risk of removal or dissipation. A distinction must however be drawn between dissipation in the course of business or day to day living on the one hand and dissipation with a view to defeating or avoiding judgment on the other. It is the latter at which the Mareva injunction is aimed. Accordingly, a Mareva injunction will only be granted where it appears to the court that the dissipation in question is likely to be made for the purpose of preventing enforcement of a judgment (see generally Fleming Ranks (Ireland) Ltd [1983] ILRM 541 and Mahony Horgan [1995] 2 411).

It is usual, as the applicant can only guess as to the necessary sums in question, for the parte order to be varied at the inter partes hearing to take account of this requirement once the respondent has filed evidence. Different principles apply where the fund in question is itself in dispute so that the trial will determine whether it belongs to the applicant or respondent. In these circumstances the court will be very slow to allow any sum to be unfrozen in aid of the respondent''s legal or day to day costs. The Mareva order binds all third parties who have notice of the same.

Although it is the case that such advice is ordinarily sought in the context of litigation, the proximity of litigation is strictly irrelevant provided that the communication passes in the course of a professional relationship. In contrast, litigation privilege covers communications between (a) a lawyer and a client (such as instructions), communications between a client and a third party, and communications between a lawyer and third party (typically, a barrister or expert witness) in preparation of contemplated litigation. LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE The rationale for legal advice privilege was best expressed by Knight-Bruce in Pearse Pearse (1846) 1 & 12 at 28-29: Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much. And surely the meanness and mischief of prying into one''s confidential relations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness and suspicion, and fear into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.'),

It has been said that if the privilege did not exist everyone would be, either thrown upon their own legal resources and deprived of professional assistance or would only tell his counsellor half his case. Thus, the logic is that legal advice privilege thereby serves the administration of justice. As Finlay remarked in Smurfit Paribas Bank AAB Export Finance Ltd in justifying the privilege: Where a person seeks or obtains legal advice there are good reasons to believe that he necessarily enters the arena of potential litigation. In order to establish a legal advice privilege, it is necessary to show that the document or information sought to be disclosed consists of a confidential communication made in the course of a professional relationship for the purposes of giving or receiving legal advice. These separate aspects of the privilege will now be examined. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE THERE MUST A COMMUNICATION A communication covers all information which passes between the lawyer and client for the purposes of giving, receiving and formulating legal advice.'),

According to Central Criminal Court, Francis [1989] 346 the common law has not confined ''communications'' to statements or documents, and these potentially include physical items such as a blood sample. There are significant limitations to the concept of a communication: The privilege only applies to lawyer and client communications not communications with third parties even though they relate to a matter upon which advice was sought. The communication can, however, pass through a law firm''s agent or a client''s agent who is engaged to accept legal advice on the client''s behalf and still attract the privilege. The communication must evolve from a professional relationship and does not apply to pre-existing documentation which is made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. (iii) The privilege only applies to facts communicated and not every fact a lawyer may learn in the course of a professional relationship with his client.

IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE, THE COMMUNICATION MUST BE IMPARTED IN CONFIDENCE A communication must be imparted in confidence in order to attract the privilege (see Bord gCon Murphy [1970] 301). What is confidential will depend on the circumstances. A factor which militates against a confidential communication, although not conclusive, is the presence of a third party. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE, THE COMMUNICATION MUST BE MADE IN THE COURSE OF A PROFESSIONAL LEGAL RELATIONSHIP The communication must be made in the course of a professional legal relationship or with the intent of establishing one. It applies to professionally qualified members of those bodies that are subject to regulation (solicitors and barristers) as well as salaried in-house legal advisers, foreign lawyers and the Attorney General. It does not include a non-lawyer or someone who has ceased to practice as a lawyer though it will apply if the client reasonably believes the person to be a lawyer.

For such communications there does not appear to me to be any sufficient public interest or feature of the common good to be secured or protected which could justify an exemption from disclosure. Kelly in Miley Flood [2001] ILRM 489 extracted from Smurfit the principle that a communication only attracts privilege if it seeks or obtains legal advice. In Miley he rejected the contention that privilege could be claimed in respect of the identity of a client, as that was a mere collateral fact unconnected with the provision of legal advice. Similarly, it is arguable that the address of a client and details of when a lawyer met a client would lack privilege on the basis of their being collateral facts.

Such a distinction is very difficult to discern, however. Virtually all cases of legal assistance, including straightforward leases and wills, engender some degree of pre-emptive consideration of the possibility of future dispute and litigation. The effect of introducing an unclear distinction within the legal professional privilege may be to undermine the public interest served by the privilege, namely the preservation of lawyer-client candour unstrained by the threat of publicity, and to invite more frequent challenge to documentation claimed to be privileged as legal. It might be noted that in Gallagher Stanley & National Maternity Hospital [1998] 2 267 the Supreme Court referred to legal professional privilege attaching to "confidential communications passing between lawyer and client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance" or in contemplation of litigation.

The privilege also protects communications between either, a client or his lawyer with third parties, such as potential witnesses or experts, where they are made in preparation for litigation which is, at the time of the communication, pending or reasonably apprehended. In Silver Hill Duckling Ltd Minister for Agriculture [1987] ILRM 516, Hanlon stated: Once litigation is apprehended or threatened, a party to such litigation is entitled to prepare his case, whether by means of communications passing between him and his legal advisers, or by means of communications passing between him and third parties, and to do so under the cloak of privilege. It is essential that litigation should be reasonably apprehended (see Gallagher Stanley & National Maternity Hospital [1998] 2 267). The problem in this area is where documents were formulated with mixed motives (i.e. a litigious purpose and a non-litigious purpose). In Waugh British Railways Board [1980] 521 it was established that a document will be protected by privilege where the "dominant purpose" for its creation is apprehended litigation.

An application of the dominant purpose test is found in the aforementioned Gallagher Stanley which concerned medical negligence. The issue in the case concerned the disclosure of witness statements made by three nurses in the immediate aftermath of the Plaintiff''s complicated delivery. The statements had been organised by the matron who gave evidence in the proceedings that she had been solely motivated by the possibility of litigation. O''Flaherty rejected that evidence. Although litigation might have been on her mind, he thought that she was likely to have been primarily motivated by her management duties. O''Flaherty endorsed the dominant purpose test. In deciding that legal professional privilege did not attach to the statements, he was influenced by the basis of the privilege and the fact that a witness statement was distinct from legal advice and instruction.

A bald assertion that documents were prepared "in contemplation of legal proceedings" accompanied by a claim of litigation privilege is unacceptable and does not discharge the burden of proof. This is clearly because the opposing party has no means of challenging such a statement, absent sight of the documents. If a party insists on withholding documents which are relevant to the issues in the proceedings on the basis that they are privileged, they must set out in their affidavit information and evidence sufficient to demonstrate the claim to privilege.

EXCEPTIONS TO LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE In principle, exceptions to legal professional privilege can exist where such are in the public interest or flow from public policy. Finlay in Smurfit Paribas Bank AAB Export Finance Ltd. stated that a privilege may only be: Granted by the courts in instances which have been identified as securing an objective which in the public interest in proper conduct of the administration of justice can be said to outweigh the disadvantage arising from the restriction of disclosure of all the facts.'),

COMMUNICATIONS IN FURTHERANCE OF CONDUCT WHICH IS CRIMINAL, FRAUDULENT OR INJURIOUS TO THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE The rationale for this rule is that such communications "cannot possibly be otherwise than injurious to the interests of justice and to those of the administration of justice" (per Stephan in Cox and Railton (1884) 14 QBD 153). Fraud is not just confined to criminal cases but encompasses civil cases such as the tort of deceit, fraudulent breach of trust, conspiracy, trickery and sham contrivances. In Murphy Kirwan [1993] 3 50 the Supreme Court recognised that: Professional privilege cannot and must not be applied so as to be injurious to the interests of justice and to those in the administration of justice where persons have been guilty of conduct of moral turpitude or of dishonest conduct even though it may not be fraud. In that case the court held that the privilege was lost and the conduct amounted to falsely and maliciously bringing an action to abuse for an ulterior or improper purpose the process of the court.

The court further rejected the submission that it should examine the documents to determine if they are relevant. Sufficient moral turpitude will exist where legal advice is sought with the intention of defeating the legal advice and entitlements of a person. In Murphy Kirwan, the Supreme Court was divided on the level of proof required to substantiate an allegation of malicious prosecution raised by the Defendants in an attempt to defeat the Plaintiff''s claim to legal professional privilege. Finlay in his majority judgment, was of the view that the party seeking disclosure should establish that his allegation is ''plausible or viable'' whilst Egan dissenting, considered that here must be some prima facie evidence that the allegation has a foundation in fact." It is arguable that Egan J''s test is stronger in that it requires an element of persuasive evidence sufficient to justify a reasonable inference in favour of the claim of disclosure. Privilege is not necessarily lost, however, if the lawyer warns the client that unless he acts in a certain way, he will be liable to prosecution, as was held in Butler Board of Trade [1971] 680. This is because the common law recognises that a legitimate function of legal advice is to warn clients of the possible consequences of their actions.'),

Strangers to the lawyerclient relationship cannot invoke the privilege. WAIVER OF LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE The client can waive privilege expressly or impliedly.

A client will be deemed to have waived privilege if he puts the contents of legal communications in issue (see McMullen Carty (Unreported, Supreme Court, January 1998). In McMullen the Supreme Court acknowledged that where a client sues his solicitor for alleged negligence in the conduct of earlier proceedings, he implicitly waives his privilege with respect not only to communications between the solicitor and himself but also as between the solicitor and counsel retained for the case. He has done so by putting the communications in issue. The English courts have considered the effect of reference in the trial to information contained in privileged documents, and whether incidental or intentional reference has a knock-on effect in shedding the document and other related documents of their privileged status through implied waiver. Phipson (Phipson on Evidence Sweet & Maxwell, 1990) at 527) has long been of the view that English law unnecessarily protects against the loss of privilege in this way, and that where a party reveals part of his hand privilege should be lost extensively.

BONA FIDE ATTEMPT TO SETTLE The party asserting the privilege must show that a dispute existed between the parties in which legal proceedings had commenced or were contemplated and that the communication was made in a genuine attempt to further negotiations to settle that dispute. The communication must be made in furtherance of the settlement of the dispute. Thus, in Flanagan Ray-Ger Ltd. (Unreported, High Court, April 1983) Costello concluded that the privilege did not apply because the communication was not an offer to settle but a statement as to the rights of the Plaintiff and her husband in relation to certain property.

INTENTION THAT THE COMMUNICATION WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED The courts have to establish whether the communication was made with the intention that it would not be disclosed without the other party''s consent or whether it was ''open''. The words ''without prejudice'' are of assistance but the courts will go behind those words to determine whether the communication was genuinely in furtherance of a settlement negotiation that was intended not to be disclosed. AMBIT OF THE PRIVILEGE There are two views as to the extent of the privilege. The narrow view is that the privilege is confined in its ambit to admissions made in the context of settlement negotiations. The broad view is that the privilege extends to protect a party from being prejudiced in any way by anything said in the course of settlement negotiations. The Irish view is contained in Ryan Connolly [2001] 2 ILRM 174.'),

The court is not precluded from considering and acting upon such communications in the context of submissions that the Defendant induced the claimant to believe that a settlement would be reached and that there was no necessity to institute proceedings within the relevant limitation period. Thus, the Irish courts engage in a balancing exercise based on policy and the public interest in determining whether to sanction the application of the privilege or not. The privilege is the joint privilege of the parties and if negotiations fail a privileged communication may only be disclosed to the court with the consent of each of the parties. However, if negotiation succeeds the fact of compromise is admissible. Further, without prejudice communications are admissible if a question arises as to whether the negotiations led to an agreement and as to what was actually agreed between the parties and whether that gives rise to an estoppel. The parties may waive the privilege. In general, without prejudice communications are inadmissible in any subsequent litigation connected with the same subject matter, whether between the same or different parties.'),

The matter was at last thoroughly explored in Murphy Dublin Corporation [1972] 215. In Murphy the Plaintiff sought a declaration that a compulsory purchase order made by the Defendant corporation and confirmed by the Minister for Local Government was invalid. The Minister objected to the production of a report made by one of his inspectors on the ground that its production would be "contrary to public policy and the public interest and service". In the Supreme Court, Walsh with whom the other four judges agreed, held that it was for the Court, and not the Minister, to decide whether documents should be disclosed and, in doing so, the court would determine where the public interest lay and would not automatically accept the view of the Minister.

McCarthy commented that the Constitution guarantees fair procedures in the administration of justice and that discovery of documents is part of these procedures. Finlay further indicated that the administration of justice is confined to the courts and the power to compel the production of evidence is an inherent part of the judicial power which determines where the public interest lies in ordering disclosure or not. The court is entitled, but not obligated, to examine any particular document before deciding whether it is exempt from production or not and can if it so decides uphold a claim for privilege in respect of a document merely on the basis of a description of its nature and contents. In any event there can be no generally applicable ''class'' privilege exempting a document from production by reason of the rank in the public service of the person creating it, or of the position of the individual or body intending to use it.

An important but not determinative consideration is whether the documents are highly relevant to the disposition of the case. It is necessary to determine to what extent the documents may advance the Plaintiff''s case or damage the Defendant''s case or fairly lead to an enquiry which may have either of those consequences (see Breathnach Ireland (No. 3) [1993] 2 448). A further important consideration is whether the litigant is seeking to vindicate a constitutional right. Thus, a document may be deemed to be privileged in order to protect a constitutional right such as the right to life (see Burke Central Independent Television [1994] 2 61). Finally, where the innocence of a person is at stake there is an overriding public interest in ensuring that an innocent person is not convicted. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE There are four main exceptions to disclosure in this context and these are set out separately below: National Security A document will ordinarily not be disclosed where it affects the vital interests of the State. The courts determine what national security is and just because a document is unquestionably confidential or sensitive it does not follow that it will not be disclosed (see Gormley Ireland [1993] 2 75).'),

This public interest is not absolute. In particular, the courts have decided that having regard to the provisions of the Constitution there is no absolute privilege in relation to confidential communications between States. (iii) Proper Functioning of the Public Service The courts will weigh the public interest in the proper functioning of the public service against the public interest in the disclosure. The public service extends beyond central government to embrace local authorities and bodies which perform statutory functions in the public interest such as the Garda Síochána Complaints Board or a tribunal but does not include the Law Society. The argument for the privilege is to foster candour in the public service and that the free and candid communications between persons in the public service would be chilled if there were no privilege. The problem with this argument is that it requires the recognition of a class claim which was rejected in Murphy and such arguments claiming privilege have often been unsuccessful given that the injustice to the Plaintiff is often greater than the difficult to estimate damage to the public service.'),

Keane confirmed this view in Breathnach Ireland [1993] 2 448 where the courts were required to weigh the public interest in the proper administration of justice against the public interest in the prevention and prosecution of crime. It was held that only where the former outweighed the latter that an inspection should be undertaken or disclosure ordered.

The judges may inspect a document to ascertain if the claim of privilege is well founded. The court can, but is not obligated, to examine the documents and can, if necessary, edit the documents. (For an example of a case where the court examined documents see the case of O''Driscoll IBRC Limited [2015] 4 JIC 2402 in the Commercial Court - concerning compliance with discovery and the issue of privilege). Given that public interest affects the public as a whole it can be invoked by any party to the litigation or by the court of its own motion. Somewhat inconsistently with this public dimension of the privilege the courts have held that it can be waived. PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE AND RESIDUAL EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE The Constitution has had the effect of conferring absolute privilege upon executive and parliamentary communications, in some cases expressly and others implicitly. Article 15.12 created a privilege and/or ''immunity'' over "[a]ll official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published".'),

In Attorney General Hamilton (No. 2) [1993] 2 277 the Supreme Court considered whether parliamentary privilege is lost when a member outside the Dáil or Seanad repeats the allegation or information, such as before a tribunal of inquiry. The High Court had decided that since parliamentary privilege is absolute it should be narrowly construed, and upon this basis the privilege did not implicitly extend to ''statements'' repeated by the member outside the Oireachtas or tendered as evidence before a tribunal of inquiry. The Supreme Court disagreed and found that the true construction of Articles 15.12 and 15.13 was that any utterance first made in either House of the Oireachtas, wheresoever published, remains privileged in the context of any legal proceedings. Thus, the privilege was not lost upon "factually similar" repetition of the information by the member outside the Oireachtas, and the source of the information remained confidential.'),

Although the words ''private papers'' are not used in Arts. 15(12) or 15(13), they appear in Art. 15(10) in the context of a provision declaring the ability of each House to "make its own rules and standing orders, with power... to ensure freedom of debate, and to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members".

On a more general level, he emphasised that the components of Art. 15 must be read schematically, and a clear underlying principle is the ''freedom of debate'' identified in Art. 15(10). Kearns expressed the following view of the nature of parliamentary privilege arising under Art. 15: The power, it seems to me, can only be seen as creating a complete protection in the nature of a privilege, being one of a unique character which is created by the Constitution and which is either self-executing or which requires only the expression of the will of the House to give it full constitutional effect. Any interpretation that the power is somehow qualified would leave the judicial branch on a potential collision course with either House whenever exercising its power under Article 15.10, precisely the opposite of what the Article is intended to achieve.

It was appropriate then that the common law principles governing this question of privilege are developed in Ireland "in harmony with the national spirit" and the "special position" afforded by the Constitution to the Roman Catholic Church. In developing a new basis for the privilege, Gavan Duffy approved four criteria favoured by Wigmore for the general purpose of conferring privilege upon communications by virtue of the confidential nature of the relationship between the communicants. According to these criteria, privilege may be established where the court is satisfied that: (1) the communication was confidential; (2) confidentiality is essential to the satisfactory maintenance of the relationship; (3) the relationship is one the community deems necessary to foster; and (4) the likely harm caused by mandatory disclosure outweighs the benefit to be gained in the instant case.'),

Gavan Duffy assumed in Cook that the sacerdotal privilege vesting in the parish priest operated in an absolute sense - in other words, that it did not entitle the court to consider the question of disclosure by weighing competing interests in the balance. This conclusion might appear doubtful in the light of subsequent developments whereby the court weighs the application of a privilege against the public interest and justice in ordering disclosure. Privilege may not exist where confidentiality of relationship and exchange is absent. In Forristal Forristal (1966) 100 ILTR 182 Deale noted that Gavan Duffy had confined his ruling in Cook to private exchanges between a priest and his parishioner.

There was no analogy between the teachings of scientology and the seal of the confessional, and no evidence had been adduced that disclosure of what transpired in scientology auditing or training sessions led to some kind of eternal punishment. The learned judge expressed some doubt as to whether the Church of Scientology even constituted a religion.

In this case she considered that confidentiality was an essential element in a marriage counsellor relationship and that the relationship was one that should be sedulously fostered in that the Constitution guarantees the protection of family rights under Article 41.

The judge specified that the privilege belonged to both spouses and could only be waived by both. CONFIDENTIALITY It is important to stress that just because a confidential relationship exists does not mean that the courts will not order disclosure. The courts have rejected claims of privilege in respect of a host of other erstwhile confidential communications such as communications passing between doctor and patient, a banker and a customer or an accountant and a client to name a few.

The aim of discovery is to aid a party in the progress of the litigation and to prevent unfair evidential advantage being taken at trial. It is also useful to allow the parties to winnow the issues down and define them as sharply as possible. As Matthews and Malik, in the context of the nomenclature of disclosure rather than discovery, state: The perceived advantage of the disclosure process includes fairness to both sides, playing "with all the cards face up on the table," clarifying the issue between the parties, reducing surprise at trial and encouraging settlement. Any system of disclosure should have as a broad rationale the just and efficient disposal of litigation. Matthews and Malik, Disclosure (Sweet and Maxwell, at 4. POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES OF DISCOVERY Discovery is not without its disadvantages. Discovery can be expensive and burdensome, and the courts are increasingly alert to the dangers of oppressive disclosure. Inappropriate requests for wide ranging disclosure are often dismissed as not being necessary for the fair disposal of the litigation. In Irish Nationwide Building Society Charlton (Unreported, Supreme Court March 1997) Murphy recognised the dangers of oppressive disclosure and gave admonishment and advice: There is a danger that this valuable legal procedure may be invoked unnecessarily or applied oppressively. It will always involve delay and expense.'),

It may be that litigants should consider more carefully whether in a particular case discovery is required. Even the party giving discovery can often do so by providing a mass of documents of dubious and marginal relevance. In such circumstances discovery can "far from clarifying the issues, operate as a cloud" (Matthews and Malik, Disclosure (Sweet and Maxwell, at 4). In AIB Banks plc Ernst & Whinney [1993] 1 375 Flaherty indicated that "to engage in such a tactic is as much an abuse as to withhold relevant information". In summary the courts have indicated that: (a) Discovery should not be used to hold up the business of the courts and to take a life all of its own.

That is not to gainsay in any sense that the primary test is whether the documents are relevant to the issues between the parties. Once that is established it will follow in most cases that their discovery is necessary for the fair disposal of those issues.

Where there are other equally effectual means of establishing the truth and thus providing for a fair trial then discovery may not be "necessary". This will certainly be so where it can be shown that the cost of making discovery would be significant and would greatly outweigh the costs of pursuing some alternative procedural mechanism to establish the same facts. Similar considerations apply when the likely true relevance of documentation may not become clear until the trial but where the immediate disclosure of the documentation concerned would necessarily involve disclosing highly confidential information. Furthermore, the development of a proportionality test can itself be seen as a further refinement of the concept of "necessity". ....

In McCarthy Flynn [1979] 127 Henchy indicated that a document: Includes any thing which, if adduced in evidence at the hearing of the proceedings, would be put in, or become annexed to, the court file of the proceedings. In the same case, Kenny stated that the main characteristic of a document is that it gives information. This echoed the earlier English case of Hill [1945] 329 where Humphreys stated: A document must be something which teaches you and from which you can learn something i.e. it must be something which affords information. It has been held that photographs, moving film, microfilm, videotape, audiotape and computer databases are documents. It does not matter that the information is not capable of being visually inspected. The crucial factor is that it conveys information. As Walton has commented in Grant Southwestern and County Properties Ltd [1975] 185: The mere interposition of necessity of an instrument for deciphering the information cannot make any difference in principle.

A similar requirement is contained in Order 31, Rule where an applicant is seeking an order for discovery. This sub rule provides that where the discovery ordered includes electronically stored information and the Court is satisfied that such electronically stored information is held in searchable form and can be provided without significant cost to the party from whom discovery is sought, it can further order that the documents or classes of documents specified in such order be provided electronically in the searchable form in which they are held by the party ordered to make discovery. Alternatively, where the Court is satisfied that such documents could not, if provided electronically, be subjected to a search by the party seeking discovery without incurring unreasonable expense, it can further order the party making discovery to make available inspection and searching facilities using its own information and communications technology system, so as to allow the party seeking discovery to avail of any search functionality available to the party ordered to make discovery.'),

The amendment to the rule allows the Court to direct discovery of documents that are or have been in the party''s "possession, power or procurement". Possession does not mean solely actual possession but includes documents within the power of procurement of a party (see Yates Ciba Geigy Agro Limited (Unreported, High Court, April 1986).

Applying this definition in Susquehanna International Group Limited Daniel Needham [2017] 1 ILRM 272 Baker in the High Court held (at paragraph 51) that a "presently enforceable legal right" to obtain copies of the documents includes documents available to a party through a data access request: There is no principled reason why information which is capable of being obtained by a data request cannot be the subject matter of a request for discovery.

However, the court held a person is only liable to disclose the identity of a wrongdoer if he or she has facilitated the commission of that wrong.

Norwich Pharmacol owned the patent to a chemical used for immunising poultry. Statistics published by the Customs and Excise Commissioners revealed that the number of importations of the chemical was higher than those bought in by Norwich. Norwich Pharmacol was unable to take direct steps to protect their patent, so they brought proceedings against the Commissioners to compel them to disclose the identities of the other importers. It was held that although Norwich Pharmacol had no substantive cause of action against the Commissioners, the Commissioners had facilitated the wrongdoing of the importers and were ordered to disclose their identities. Since the Norwich Pharmacol case, the rule has been extended. For example, an order was made against a settlor to disclose to potential beneficiaries the names and addresses of trustees so that the potential beneficiaries could communicate with them with a view to being considered for the distribution of trust property. The order was made even though the trustees were not accused or suspected of any wrongdoing. It is, however, clear that such an order is a matter of sparing discretion. In England and Wales, the courts have conceptualised a Norwich Pharmacol order as an equitable remedy where the courts have discretion as to whether to grant it and which is subject to four possible defences: 1.

In Sheehy and McAuley The Government of Ireland (Unreported, High Court, July 2002) the judge endorsed the dictum of Lord Diplock in Reilly Mackman, [1983] 2 237 that: The facts...can seldom be a matter of relevant dispute upon an application for judicial review. As a qualifier to the above in Ayaya Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Unreported, High Court, May 2003), Finlay Geoghegan indicated that: It is however inherent in the nature of judicial review that the necessity for discovery will be more difficult to establish than in plenary proceedings. This follows from the fact that in judicial review what is at issue is the legality of the decision challenged. In many instances the facts are not in dispute. Discovery will normally but not exclusively be confined to factual issues in dispute.'),
                                                                                                                 ('Chapter 8: Discovery', 'Civil Manual', 'Is it necessary for an applicant to have substantiated facts before seeking discovery?', 'yes_no', '{"correct":true,"justification":"it is not sufficient for an applicant simply to make an assertion not based upon any substantiated facts and then seek discovery in the hope that there will exist documents which support the assertion."}'::jsonb, ARRAY['AI', 'Civil'], 'It can be envisaged that an applicant for judicial review may raise a factual issue and whilst not disputed consider there are documents in the possession of the respondent which would assist in the proof of relevant facts at the hearing and that a Court would take the view that discovery of such documents is necessary for disposing fairly of the application for judicial review. The limitation on such discovery in such circumstances is that it must not be considered to be a fishing exercise. It is difficult to state in a general way the precise dividing line but it is clear that it is not sufficient for an applicant simply to make an assertion not based upon any substantiated facts and then seek discovery in the hope that there will exist documents which support the assertion. (Emphasis added) In Secretary of State for Health, ex-parte Hackney London Borough and Others (Unreported, Court of Appeal, July 1994) Bingham stated the test as: Have they raised a factual issue of sufficient substance, or adduced evidence which grounds a reasonable suspicion of unlawfulness, such that the application cannot be fairly resolved without discovery?'),

There is an obvious sense in which discovery sought at the leave stage is analogous to an action for discovery for the purposes of intended proceedings.

The scope of Rule 18 and the general operation of inspection was discussed in some depth by Kelly in Cooper Flynn RTE [2000] 3 344. In his decision, the judge followed a stream of English authority. First, he cited Lord Scarman in Air Canada Secretary of State for Trade [1983] 2 394 where the Law Lord indicated at page 444 that: It may well be that, where there is no claim of confidentiality or public interest immunity or any objection on the ground of privilege, the courts follow a relaxed practice, allowing production on the basis of relevance. This is sensible bearing in mind the extended meaning given to relevance in Compagnie Financiere Commerciale Pacifique Peruvian Guano (1882) 11 Q.B.D. 55. Kelly indicated that if confidentiality is asserted, or another ground of objection arises, Rule 18 assumes relevance and it becomes necessary to decide whether inspection is necessary for the fair disposal of the action. The learned judge referred to the speech of Lord Scarman in Science Research Council'),

The factor of confidence however militates against general orders for discovery and does impose upon the tribunal the duty of satisfying itself, by inspection if need be that justice requires disclosure. Kelly then indicated that the authorities establish that disclosure will be necessary if it gives a ''litigious advantage'' to the party seeking inspection and the information sought is not otherwise available to that party by, for example, admissions, or some other form of proceeding (e.g. interrogatories) or from some other source, and such order for disclosure would not be oppressive, perhaps because of the sheer volume of the documentation. In following the case of Science Research Council Nasse, Kelly indicated that the court will first inspect the documents in order: (a) to ensure that inspection is indeed necessary (that very safeguard of itself making the court generally readier to accept that the threshold test for disclosure is satisfied) and assuming it is, to see if the loss of confidentiality involved can be mitigated by: blanking out parts of the documents, and/or limiting the disclosure to legal advisors only...'),

Those words direct attention to the question whether inspection is necessary for the fair determination of the matter, whether by trial or otherwise. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that one party does not enjoy an unfair advantage or suffer an unfair disadvantage in the litigation as a result of a document not being produced for inspection. It is, think, of no importance that a party is curious about the contents of a document or would like to know the contents of it if he suffers no litigious disadvantage by not seeing it and would gain no litigious advantage by seeing it.

If the tribunal is satisfied that it is necessary to order certain documents to be disclosed and inspected in order fairly to dispose of the proceedings then, in my opinion, the law requires that such an order should be made; and the fact that the documents are confidential is irrelevant. The law has always recognised that it is of the greatest importance from the point of view of public policy that proceedings in the courts or before tribunals shall be fairly disposed of. This, no doubt, is why the law has never accorded privilege against discovery and inspection to confidential documents, which are necessary for fairly disposing of the proceedings.

Although Fennelly in Ryanair Plc Aer Rianta C.P.T.

The initial test of what this involves was formulated by Walsh in & L.S. Goodbody Ltd Clyde Shipping Company Limited, (Unreported, Supreme Court, May 1967), where he indicated that the purpose of interrogatories is to sustain the Plaintiff''s case as well as to destroy that of the Defendant and that interrogatories need not be confined to facts directly in issue but may extend to any facts the existence or non-existence of which is relevant to the fact(s) directly in issue and that interrogatories need not be conclusive on the question in issue but should have some bearing and might form a step in establishing liability. Walsh J''s test is a high watermark of liberalism in this context and was retreated upon somewhat by subsequent high courts. For example, in Mercantile Credit Corporation of Ireland Heelan [1994] 2 105 Costello indicated that actions are in principle to be heard on oral evidence and the use of evidence on affidavit given in reply to interrogatories is an exception which must be justified by some special exigency which in the interests of justice requires the exception to be allowed.

Fanning, as the facts themselves become evidence once replies are furnished to interrogatories. Above all one is not entitled to fish. O''Sullivan J''s analysis merits quotation: The distinction between "... what is mere evidence of the facts in dispute..." on the one hand, and on the other "... the facts themselves..." is a difficult one because the facts themselves become evidence once replies are furnished to interrogatories. The line between what is and is not permissible is even more difficult to lay down in light of the right to interrogate not only in relation to the facts directly in issue but in relation to any facts "the existence or non-existence of which is relevant to the existence or non-existence of the facts directly in issue." Clearly one is not entitled to "fish". One is not entitled to ask one''s opponents the name of his witnesses (unless these are part of the material facts) nor the evidence or line of evidence, which he intends to follow.'),

It is not permissible to deliver interrogatories which are of a fishing character or which seek to obtain the name of opponents witnesses (Griebert Morris [1920] 1 659). In McCole Blood Transfusion Service Board (Unreported, High Court, June 1996) the court, echoing Costello J''s judgment in the Mercantile case, emphasised the importance of cross examination at trial for eliciting information and indicated that interrogatories had to be essential for preparation of the case such that if left to cross examination the party would be irremediably prejudiced. In Quilligan Sugrue (Unreported, High Court, February 1984) the court stated: No doubt in many running down cases it might be right not to allow interrogatories because they are not "necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs as where the Plaintiff can call witnesses who saw the accident.'),

In Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited Thomas Browne [2011] IEHC 140 Kelly made a number of general comments about interrogatories in the context of a discovery application. Discovery ought not to be ordered where the information sought to be gleaned by it is capable of being obtained by an alternative less expensive and less time consuming method. In this regard, have in mind the use of interrogatories. In the Commercial List, interrogatories may be delivered as of right. No recourse to the court is necessary and they are capable of being administered in every case. Interrogatories are in many instances superior to discovery. That is so for a trinity of reasons. First, they ask a direct question.'),

Second, the interrogatories must be answered. Moreover, they are answered under oath. Third, the interrogatories, once answered, may be utilised as evidence in the trial thereby avoiding the necessity to call one or more witnesses. Interrogatories need no longer be framed in an archaic form by posing questions in the negative. They can ask direct questions. have seen many cases in this division of the court where a large reduction in discovery and considerable shortening of trial time was achieved by the answering of, by times, in excess of a hundred interrogatories. Given the easy availability of interrogatories in the Commercial List, it is important that practitioners utilise that facility. When seeking to obtain information from their opponents, the first port of call ought not to be requests for discovery if it is probable that the information which is being sought is capable of being elicited by an adroit use of interrogatories. Whilst the comments of Kelly were made in the context of Commercial Court proceeding his preference to negate the necessity for wide ranging discovery and his practical consideration on the interplay between interrogatories and discovery is certainly of relevance and may indeed influence the future jurisprudence in this area.'),

The categories of information which must be disclosed are specified by a combination of section 45(1)(a) of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and Order 39 Rule 46.

However, in practice a Defendant may seek to rely on the Order even where the Plaintiff has a good claim and may attempt to use it as a tactical weapon in the proceedings. PROCEDURE IN THE HIGH COURT Procedurally, an order for security for costs may be granted to a Defendant where the Plaintiff is resident outside the jurisdiction where a Defendant establishes on affidavit that he has: * a prima facie defence on the merits and * there are no other special circumstances which might influence the exercise of the court''s discretion in the Plaintiff''s favour. The practice is that the Defendant applies to the other party for security and, if within 48 hours that other party fails to undertake to provide security or furnish a satisfactory reply, the former party shall be at liberty to apply to the court that the latter should furnish such security (Order 29, Rule 1).'),

The motion is grounded upon an affidavit sworn by the Defendant (see Gardiner Harris 8 252). If the High Court orders that security for costs be given, the amount of that security and the manner and form in which security for costs is to be given will be determined by the Master of the High Court on application being made to the Master for that purpose (Order 29, Rule 6). This application to the Master is by notice of motion grounded upon an affidavit which will often be sworn by the Defendant''s solicitor, exhibiting an estimate of the costs likely to be incurred. This is normally prepared by a cost drawer/legal cost accountant. The party opposing (normally the Plaintiff) is free to file a replying affidavit exhibiting an estimate from their own cost drawer/legal cost accountant and the Master will make a decision as to the amount of the security to be given having considered both affidavits and their respective exhibits.'),

The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, acknowledging that it might not be in a financial position to meet the costs of the action if unsuccessful, but claiming that the court should exercise its discretion to refuse the application for security for costs for two principal reasons. First, the plaintiff contended that the defendants had not demonstrated a prima facie defence and, secondly, the plaintiff claimed that there were special circumstances - namely the defendants'' delay of one year in seeking security for costs which disentitled the defendants to the relief sought.

The defendants'' actions in allowing the case to proceed for one year before seeking security for costs, while aware of the plaintiff''s financial weakness, constituted special circumstances disentitling them to the order sought.

Attention is given as to whether there is an arguable case (see Peppard & Ltd Bogoff [1962] 180).

The Court further found that: the principles and the scope of the discretion to be exercised by the court in an application for security for costs pursuant to Order 31 Rule 12, being an exercise by the court of its inherent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of court, are the same as those outlined by Kingsmill Moore in relation to Order 29. The discretion to be exercised is, as he stated, a very broad one and certainly, where it is appropriate, account may be taken of any particular factors which might arise because one relates to the procedural remedy of discovery and the other to the security for costs of proceedings.

That is clearly consistent with the approach set out by Kingsmill Moore In relation to whether and to what extent there is a distinction between security for costs in a discovery application and substantive proceedings the Court indicated that: Certainly there are distinctions to be made between the effect of an order for security for costs where this might amount to an obstacle to a party having access to the courts in respect of his or her substantive proceedings and one which may have the apparently more limited effect of simply being an obstacle to obtaining discovery. This may be a material distinction in the circumstances of a particular case, but in a case where discovery was essential to a party''s ability to make a claim or to defend an action the implication may be substantially the same.

That is also an important consideration in whether or not to grant an order for security for costs and if so the amount of same. That is not to say that the sole fact that the granting of an order for discovery would be an obstacle to a party proceeding with its action or its defence would in itself be a bar to an order for discovery, but it is a factor to be taken into account, at least in fixing the amount of the security, because, as Kingsmill Moore pointed out, if too large it may defeat an honest and substantial claim because the Plaintiff cannot find the necessary security.'),

In the case of McCann Judge of Monaghan District Court and others; [2009] 4 2000 the High Court found section 6 to be unconstitutional on the grounds that section 6 lacked a number of necessary safeguards where a person was at risk of imprisonment. The judgment states that while this process has traditionally been regarded as a civil matter, the effect was similar to a criminal process and as a result, the debtor was entitled to similar protections. The High Court was particularly concerned that section 6 did not appear to require a person to be heard by a court before being imprisoned, as in criminal proceedings, it is generally the case that a person must be present in court if there is a possibility of imprisonment.

The costs of a trial depend on a number of criteria including the expected length, complexity, the number of Counsel to be instructed and the fees of any experts who may be required to attend.

To extend time in the absence of an arguable ground would simply waste the time of the litigants and the court.

It is a public law subject in that it focuses on the relationship between the individual and state authorities, whereas private law (such as contract or tort) focuses on relations between individuals. With the growth of the organs of state, many state functions that fundamentally affect the rights of individuals are now carried out by administrative bodies or tribunals. It is imperative therefore that some manner of control is exercised over such bodies to ensure that their functions are carried out in accordance with law. This concept of the "rule of law" underpins Irish administrative law. It encompasses four key principles. First, that every executive or administrative act that affects legal rights or interests must have legal justification. Secondly every entity, including the government and its servants, are subject to the law. Thirdly, the legality of executive or administrative acts is to be determined by judges who are independent of the government and finally, that the law should be public and precise and its operation predictable. In accordance with the rule of law, the High Court exercises supervisory jurisdiction over a range of administrative bodies and tribunals (as well as the lower courts) through the procedure of judicial review.'),

In a judicial review application, a court will review matters such as whether the proper procedures were applied in reaching the decision at first instance, or whether the original decision-maker had proper jurisdiction, or whether he applied the correct legal principles in making the decision that is being challenged. It varies fundamentally from a full appeal where the decision itself can be questioned on the merits. When the High Court reviews administrative law decisions, it is concerned with the legality of the decision, not necessarily its merits. Thus, it cannot strike down a decision simply because it does not like it or because it would prefer an alternative conclusion. The High Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the administrative body whose decision is being challenged. The principles applicable to judicial review of administrative decisions have been described as follows in State (Abenglen Properties Ltd.) Dublin Corporation [1984] 381 at 392. From this emergence three centuries ago of the means by which the Court of King''s Bench controlled the judicial process of lower courts, the remedy of certiorari has been developed and extended to reach far beyond the mere control of judicial process in courts as such.'),

Despite this development and extension, however, certiorari still retains its essential features. Its purpose is to supervise the exercise of jurisdiction by such bodies or tribunals and to control any usurpation or action in excess of jurisdiction.

Thus, if a decision purely affects the rights of private parties and does not have a public dimension, then the public law remedy of judicial review will not lie. In determining whether a decision has a public element, the court will look at the source of the power being invoked and the nature of the power. While the courts in the past have focussed on the source of the power, it seems it is now the nature of the power exercised that is the most important factor.

For this reason, an applicant is often required to demonstrate that he or she is in some way affected or prejudiced by the impugned decision. This is not an immutable requirement: in certain instances, the nature of the decision under review is such that no particular member of the public will be in a position to point to a prejudice peculiar to him or her.

This gloss seems intended to prevent an applicant stowing away a legal objection for future use in judicial review proceedings. (This matter is discussed further below.) In the different context of the locus standi requirement to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, the leading case is Cahill Sutton [1980] 269. In this case, Henchy stated that an applicant must "show that the impact of the impugned law on his personal situation discloses an injury or prejudice which he has either suffered or is in imminent danger of suffering" However, Henchy stressed that the rule should be applied in a flexible manner and that in certain cases, the want of normal locus standi could be overlooked.'),

Lancefort Ltd was incorporated specifically for purposes of challenging the decision after the An Bord Pleanála decision to grant permission had been made. It was argued that the applicant did not have standing to bring judicial review proceedings on the grounds that it had not participated in the planning process and because it had insufficient assets to meet any award of costs made against it. The Supreme Court accepted that a company acting in a representative capacity may in particular circumstances, have the requisite standing and that a company should not be deprived of standing simply because it had not participated in the appeal process and had come into existence after the decision being challenged had been made.

Instead of determining the locus standi issue separately, the court in Lancefort looked to the merits of the case in arriving at the conclusion that it should refuse relief to the applicant in this particular case. The Supreme Court itself has elaborated upon the rationale in Lancefort Ltd. in Mulcreevy Minister for the Environment [2004] 1 ILRM 419. In this case, the applicant sought to prevent construction work on the south-eastern motorway along a route through the remains of Carrickmines castle. While the applicant had no private interest in the proceedings, there was no suggestion that he had brought the action for any other reason than to ensure that a national monument was not damaged.

AND ARGUABLE CASE DPP sets out the requirement that an applicant must have an arguable or stateable case in order to obtain leave for judicial review proceedings. It has been made clear in the subsequent case of O''Reilly Cassidy [1995] 1 ILRM that in determining an application for leave, the court does not concern itself with what the eventual result of the case might be. It merely determines whether the applicant has an arguable case and it is not appropriate for it to express any view on whether the applicant''s arguments are strong or weak. In Gordon DPP [2002] 2 369 (which is discussed more fully below), the Supreme Court referred to the leave requirement as a "low threshold" and a "light burden." In certain specific cases, such as planning or immigration matters, statute imposes a more onerous obligation on an applicant to show "substantial grounds" for the application at the leave stage. These applications are usually on notice to the respondents. Furthermore, in some rare cases, the judge may decide that he wishes to hear the respondent at the leave stage.'),

In that situation, O''Caoimh held that a higher standard should apply than that of establishing an "arguable case". In so holding, the learned judge applied the views of Kelly expressed obiter in Gorman Minister for Environment [2001] 1 306 to the effect that since both sides had given detailed arguments and the points were canvassed in much greater detail than in an parte hearing, then leave should only be granted if the case is "not merely arguable but is strong, that it is to say, is likely to succeed."

In voicing this opinion note that in both Gorman Minister for the Environment [2001] 1 I.R. 306 and other cases cited reliance was placed on English case law. However, it appears to me that the appropriate law is that which has been well established in this jurisdiction based on Director of Public Prosecutions.

It is still required to be shown that a prima facie legal argument has been established. In terms of evidence, the requirement for a prima facie case is regarded as that which "if not balanced or outweighed by other evidence, will suffice to establish a particular contention"; Halsbury''s Law of England (5 edition) volume 11, paragraph 767. In terms of law, the test is no different: it is a point of law which if not balanced or outweighed by other principles will suffice to establish the contention.

IMMIGRATION & PLANNING MATTERS It should be noted that in certain specific matters, for instance planning and immigration decisions, statute prescribes a special judicial review procedure. There are strict time limits for parte leave applications in these two areas (28 days for immigration matters and 8 weeks for planning matters). Note that the threshold for obtaining leave in such applications is that the applicant must show "substantial grounds" - a higher threshold than an arguable case. STAY ON PROCEEDINGS Under Order 84, Rule 20 (8), where relief sought is prohibition or certiorari, the court may make an order staying the proceedings, order or decision to which the application relates until the determination of the application for judicial review or until the court otherwise orders.

In Donnell Brady [2001] 3 588, the Supreme Court stated that there is nothing in the wording of Order 84, Rule 20(7) which indicates that such a stay is automatic. The Court appeared to accept that the principles applicable to the granting or discharge of a stay were the same as those governing the granting of an interlocutory injunction. Keane also hinted that when the grant of a stay is challenged by a respondent, that the onus may be on an applicant to satisfy the court that it is an appropriate case to grant such a stay. See also Farrell Governor of Patricks [2014] 699.

The court also concluded that it is the version put forward by the applicant which should normally (in the absence of allegations that there has been non-disclosure or an absence of the utmost good faith) be presumed to be correct for the purpose of determining whether there is an arguable case. Fennelly stressed that the leave procedure is a mechanism to filter out frivolous or vexatious applications. While the court can set aside clearly unmeritorious applications which have slipped through the net, or those made other than in utmost good faith, he stressed that the jurisdiction to set aside should not be allowed to operate as a pre-emptive hearing of the substantive trial.'),

Given that leave will generally have been obtained parte, the relevant documents should now be served on the respondent. The motion or summons, together with a copy of the order granting leave, the statement of grounds and the verifying affidavit must be served within 7 days after perfection of the order granting leave, or such other time as the court may direct.

The intention of the rules appears to be to place a greater emphasis on the Statement of Opposition (which must set out the facts relied upon) than the verifying affidavit. The Statement of Opposition (as with any pleading) should be drafted with precision see the judgment of Eagar in Child and Family Agency [2017] IEHC 50 where he stated that precision in pleadings may be seen as part of the duty of the respondent to co-operate with the Court.

These submissions include a brief summary of the legal arguments advanced by each side together with copies of the relevant legislation, case law or textbooks relied upon.

Once the court is satisfied that all pre-trial matters have been disposed of, an application can be made for a hearing date to the judge in charge of the list.

The time limits provide that at least in theory, motion papers will have been served, a statement of opposition provided and written submissions exchanged between the parties prior to the first return date of the motion. This timetable does not make provision for the exchange of further affidavits in the interim. It would make sense that an exchange of affidavits should precede the exchange of written submissions. Order 84, Rule 22(8) provides that on the return date, or any adjournment thereof, the court may give certain directions as to whether at the hearing of the application for judicial review it shall require oral submissions in respect of any of the written submissions of the parties on points or issues of law. Although the wording of this rule might suggest that oral submissions are at the option of the judge, it would be a surprise if this interpretation were adopted.

The types of interlocutory application permitted are wide-reaching and include discovery, inspection of documents and interrogatories. HEARING/NOTICE TO CROSS-EXAMINE In most applications for judicial review, the evidence is adduced by affidavit. However, the court may order a person who has sworn an affidavit to attend for the purpose of cross-examination. Care should be taken if seeking an order to permit cross-examination that any such cross-examination relates to "relevant, material conflicts of fact" that can be resolved by way of judicial review proceedings (noting that the purpose of Judicial Review is for the court to review the decision-making process and not for the court to make the decision) - see Dunnes Stores Dublin City Council [2016] IEHC 724, Barrett Although an order will be required in the absence of agreement, parties may agree to allow a particular party to be cross-examined and can thus save the costs of an application.'),

Co-operative negotiators use factual/ legal argument to persuade other side of the fairness and justice of accepting/rejecting a proposal. Collaborative negotiators use factual/ legal argument to define and persuade the other side to accept the objective standard against which proposals should be measured.

A definition of a concession is: ''Agreement to move from a stated position/proposition in a direction less favourable to the negotiator making the statement'' Given this definition, a concession and an offer in the negotiation are often one and the same thing. Concessions should be distinguished from statements that make clear what facts are agreed and disputed. Identify and plan: 1. what you want to achieve in the negotiation. Given the merits of the client''s case you should identify the best outcome on each item for negotiation. Given the merits of the client''s case identify the lowest acceptable outcome on each item for negotiation. 2. Identify any other options client has if negotiation fails. 3. Identify what is the best alternative option client has if no agreement (BATNA Best Alternative To A Negotiated Agreement). 4. Identify the likely outcome on each item for negotiation if matter went to court. Given the above you should then consider: 1.

They will be polite, friendly and courteous but make very few concessions, and make extreme demands. Beware the "wolf in sheep''s clothing"!

A concession is an ''agreement to move from a stated position/proposition in a direction less favourable to the negotiator making the statement''. For example, sometimes a small concession can be made to appear much larger, prompting a genuinely large concession from the other side; and tactically there may be advantages in not making any planned concessions early on, to give an impression of progress.

Thus, where the acknowledgement that a debt is due is made in writing and signed by the person acknowledging it, the cause of action is deemed to accrue on the date of the acknowledgement and not before. Similarly, Section 65 (1) provides that where any right of action to recover a debt has accrued and the debtor makes a part payment towards that debt, the cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the part payment.

It is common case that discoverability, as such, cannot be relevant in considering what is the appropriate commencement date in respect of the limitation period. On this point at least, the view of the House of the Lords taken in Pirelli Oscar Faber and Partners [1983] 2 A.C. 1, represents Irish Law also.

In Cantrell AIB [2020] IESC 71 (a case which concerned the negligent mis-selling of a financial product), the Supreme Court held that in such claims the limitation period only begins to run when the risk renders the product less valuable. The Court concluded (at paragraph 132) that damage for the accrual of a cause of action must "bear a close relationship to the layperson''s understanding of that term.

Unlike statutory periods of limitation delay in itself is not enough to bar an equitable claim under the doctrine. The delay must be such that the Plaintiff is deemed to have acquiesced in the action complained of or that the delay has caused the Defendant to alter his position in reliance of the status quo.

If the claim has an 80% chance of success, then the opening position should be that the Judge is likely to award me these costs if we go to trial so should be entitled to them in the settlement. Before entering settlement negotiations, Counsel should, where possible know his or her sides costs to date. This will include your own costs so make sure to have this figure worked out in advance. The importance of costs in the settlement process increases through the course of the pretrial process as the costs increase and the figure being claimed remains the same.

If a Plaintiff decides to accept the lodgment, a notice of acceptance of lodgment must be filed within 14 days of the date of receipt of the notice of lodgment with a copy of same being delivered to the Defendant''s solicitor. The Defendant''s consent is required where acceptance is made outside this period. In relation to Plaintiffs under a disability (which includes infants) or of unsound mind, a lodgment or tender cannot be accepted without leave of the court. This is also the procedure in respect of lodgments in fatal injury cases.

A summons is a document served by the Plaintiff on the Defendant informing him that the Plaintiff has a claim against him and requiring him to enter an appearance to answer that claim. The summons warns the Defendant that, should he fail to enter an appearance, the Plaintiff may proceed to seek judgment in his absence. There are four types of originating summonses: 1. Plenary summons This is the most common type of summons and is used in all cases which will require further pleadings and oral evidence, unless otherwise provided for in the Rules of the Superior Courts. A plenary summons is followed by a further document from the Plaintiff, called a statement of claim, in which he sets out his claim in more detail. The Defendant will respond to the summons and statement of claim with a defence. Plenary summonses, statements of claim and defences are dealt with in more detail below. 2. Summary summons Order 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts specifies the classes of claims which may be commenced by summary summons. The most common of these are: (a) cases where the Plaintiff seeks only to recover a debt or liquidated sum of money (i.e.'),

Special summons This type of summons is used for those types of proceedings specified in Order 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts and elsewhere in legislation. Like summary summons procedure, special summons procedure is intended as an expeditious procedure without further pleadings or oral evidence. Order 38 of the Rules of the Superior Courts sets out the specific procedure for the hearing of proceedings commenced by special summons. The following are some common examples of cases which may be initiated by special summons: (a) administration of the estate of a deceased person or the determination of any question affecting the rights of anyone claiming to be entitled to a share of such estate - e.g. a claim under 117 of the Succession Act 1965 by the children of a deceased person to have proper provision made for them out of the estate; certain applications made by mortgagors or mortgagees; judicial separation and divorce (see Order 70A). 4.

The rules of court contain strict requirements in relation to the format of pleadings, their content and the time at which they must be delivered to the opposing side in litigation.

The same rules do not necessarily apply in other forms of drafting (e.g. drafting affidavits - see separate section on affidavits). PLEADINGS SHOULD CONTAIN THE MATERIAL FACTS ON WHICH THE PARTY RELIES As noted above, the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues between the parties. This is achieved by pleading the facts upon which the claim or defence is based. The facts, as pleaded, should reveal the legal cause of action or defence asserted by the party in question. The Plaintiff cannot simply allege, for example, that the Defendant was negligent. He must show how the Defendant was negligent, by reference to the facts of the case. Generally speaking, therefore, it is said that pleadings should contain facts, not law. However, in certain instances it is appropriate to refer to specific legal principles in the pleadings. Order 19 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides the following: "Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved ..."

It may ultimately result in the court refusing to allow evidence to be called on a specific unpleaded but material fact."}'::jsonb, ARRAY['AI', 'Civil'], 'However, the golden rule is that the pleadings must contain every fact which the party in question must prove in order to win his case. For example, if the Plaintiff seeks damages for negligence on the part of the Defendant, he must plead facts which, if proved, would establish the requisite elements of the tort - i.e. that the Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff, that the Defendant has failed to meet the required standard of care and that the Plaintiff has thereby suffered some loss or damage. Failing to plead each of the essential element of the claim and the material facts of such elements can have significant consequences at the trial of the action. It may ultimately result in the court refusing to allow evidence to be called on a specific unpleaded but material fact. Although it is available to bring an application to amend the pleadings this can lead to significant delay and an increase in the legal costs. The case Wildgust Bank of Ireland [2001] 1 ILRM 24 dealt with an application to amend pleadings during the course of trial. At the trial of the action the Plaintiff sought to call evidence to establish a claim based on negligent misstatement.

McGuinness stated: It does not state the duty of care owed by the second named defendant to the plaintiffs. It does not state that the communication in question was made to the plaintiffs, or at least to agents of the plaintiffs. It does not state that the plaintiffs, or indeed Hill Samuel Bank Ltd, relied on the communication or that Norwich Union knew that they would rely on it; nor does it clearly set out that the plaintiffs acted to their detriment in reliance on the communication.

At this point it will suffice to note that the court has such a power. Accordingly, it is important to ensure not only that all material facts are pleaded, but that nothing unnecessary or prolix is included in the pleadings by either party. Similarly, the court will strike out pleadings which fail to disclose a reasonable cause of action against the Defendant.

Any charge of fraud or misrepresentation must be pleaded with the utmost particularity; it will not be inferred from the circumstances pleaded, at all events if those circumstances be consistent with innocence. A general charge of fraud, however strong, without alleging specific facts, is not sufficient to sustain the action. It must be shown in what the fraud consists and how it has been effected.

Make sure to note any differences in the rules for the different courts. BASIC PRINCIPLES The initiating documents are the documents which are used to commence proceedings.

IS THERE A CLAIM? ANALYSIS AND RESEARCHFACTS AND LAW 1. Having read the papers, you should know the facts. You should know or can research the law. The law shows you how to organise and give legal significance to the facts. 2. Identify the wrong(s) committed and remedies sought: damages, injunction, declaration, certiorari. 3.

Where applicable, consider the possibility of expert evidence being required at trial 7. Identify the remedy/remedies available. IDENTIFY THE ELEMENTS REQUIRED TO PROVE THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR, IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE, EACH CAUSE OF ACTION. WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS? Before drafting, check and remind yourself of the necessary elements required to prove each cause of action. If necessary, make a list of the essential elements of the claim. See below. Draft your pleading, ensuring that you set out the material facts which must be pleaded in order to establish each element of the cause of action 1. Describe the parties: * Occupation, address, (if a company - state whether a limited liability company etc., brief description of business of the company, state the registered office). Establish any special relationships existing e.g. consumer/business; fiduciary relationship; employer/ employee etc. Establish grounds for any special statutory duty that may arise e.g. if the * Defendant is the owner/occupier of a premises and the plaintiff was a visitor to the premises or if the Plaintiff is a director of a company etc. Plead any other relevant material facts in relation to either party e.g.'),

Set out the details of the alleged wrong: i.e. plead the material facts which establish each element of the wrong. 3. If applicable, state if it is proposed/intended to call expert evidence, type of expert, what issues etc. 4. Plead the causal connection between the damage and the cause of action. 5. Plead any facts necessary to establish that the damage is not too remote/or is reasonably foreseeable. 6. Plead particulars of loss and damage unless the cause of action arises without proof of damage e.g. in certain species of defamation plead the matters which bring your action within that special category. 7. Set out the remedy/remedies being sought i.e. seek relief: "and the Plaintiff claims....". 8. If District/Circuit Court matter, plead limited to jurisdiction of court.

COURT DOCUMENTS Where reference is made in an affidavit to a ''court document'' - i.e. a document which has been lodged in the court office - it is not necessary to exhibit the document, because it will already be on the court file. Initiating documents such as summonses and civil bills are court documents and need not, therefore, be exhibited to affidavits sworn in the same proceedings. However, it is important to note that, in the High Court, other pleadings such as statements of claim and defences are not lodged in the Central Office. While reference may be made to them in a grounding affidavit, there is no requirement to exhibit them as pleadings prove themselves. Care should however be taken to ensure that copies of such documents are available in court when making an application.'),

A copy must also be served on the opposing party. Occasionally, due to the urgency of the matter, it is not possible to stamp and file the affidavit before the court hearing. This is often the case where the applicant seeks an urgent interim injunction to restrain some action. In such circumstances, the court may grant the order sought subject to an undertaking by the applicant''s solicitor to stamp and file the affidavit immediately thereafter. MISCELLANEOUS Students should be aware that there are a number of different types of affidavit which are required in specific situations that they will encounter in practice, for example: Discovery: An affidavit as to documents - See Chapter on Discovery. Personal Injuries actions: A verifying affidavit is required for each of the pleadings in a personal injuries action. See Chapter on Personal Injuries Litigation (Order 1A RSC, Order 5A CCR, Order 40A DCR). Defamation actions: Defamation Act 2009: a verifying affidavit is required for each of the pleadings in a defamation action. The form of this verifying affidavit is contained in Order of the Rules of the Superior Courts and Order of the Circuit Court Rules.'),

This means that the other side is informed and is given an opportunity to make submissions at the hearing of the application. A party is informed that an application or motion is to be heard by way of a notice of motion which is a formal document setting out the nature of the relief sought, the date on which it will be sought and the documents on which the application will be grounded. Sometimes an application will be made parte in which case only the party making the application will be present. In this situation, an parte docket is used rather than a notice of motion. It must also set out the nature of the relief sought and the documents on which the application will be grounded. AFFIDAVIT Many court applications must be grounded on an affidavit. This means that the evidence required to satisfy the court that it should make the order sought must be set out in an affidavit. An affidavit is a way of placing evidence before the court - a witness will state his evidence in writing in the affidavit. Evidence contained in an affidavit is given on oath and therefore it must be signed by the witness in the presence of a solicitor or commissioner for oaths.'),

In considering the reasons put forward to excuse the delay in effecting service, the court may have regard to the Statute of Limitations. It may be that, should the court refuse to renew the summons, the Plaintiff''s claim would become statute barred. On the one hand, this would prejudice the Plaintiff and should be seen as a reason to grant the renewal, especially where the delay was not the fault of the Plaintiff or his solicitor. On the other hand, if the Plaintiff''s own culpable delay is responsible for placing him in this position, the court may take the view that it would not be unjust to refuse the application. Regard should be had to case law on this point, in particular O''Brien Fahy (Supreme Court, tempore, March, 1997) and Roche Clayton [1998] 1 596, which show that the court will not renew the summons where this will unduly prejudice the Defendant.

In response to the document initiating a claim, the Defendant will have an opportunity to set out his Defence.

In an action for Defamation which, if any, of the defences under the 2009 Act are available? Should any of these special defences be taken as a preliminary objection (e.g. Statute of Limitations; delay in equity)?

Preliminary Objection If there is a preliminary objection to be taken, this should appear in Paragraph 1 of the Defence e.g. delay in equity; Statute of Limitations. 2. Admission/Denial of Facts Careful consideration should be given as to what matters are being denied/admitted. Which facts is the Plaintiff to be put on proof of. Remember anything not denied is deemed to be admitted. If a paragraph in the Statement of Claim contains a number of allegations, some of which are to be denied, some admitted - deal with each in a separate paragraph. 3.

Where a Plaintiff seeks judgment in default of appearance or defence, or a Defendant seeks to have the Plaintiff''s claim dismissed for want of prosecution, the court will be reluctant to prevent the other party proceeding with his case where he indicates a desire to do so. In most cases, the main reasons for bringing a motion in default of pleadings are (a) to move the case along and to penalise the other side by an order of costs. For example, in the overwhelming majority of motions for judgment in default of appearance, the court will extend the time for entry of an appearance or the Defendant will already have entered an appearance, albeit outside the prescribed time limit. This does not mean that the Plaintiff has lost his application. The Plaintiff will usually be awarded the costs of the application - meaning that the Defendant will have to pay the fees of the Plaintiff''s solicitor and counsel - because the Defendant has defaulted in his obligations under the rules of court.

Where the Defendant has failed to comply with that time limit, the Plaintiff may seek judgment in default of appearance.

Prior to bringing an application for judgment in default of appearance, the Plaintiff is required to serve a notice in writing on the Defendant confirming the intention to proceed on default of appearance and also consenting to the late appearance within 28 days of the date of the letter (See Order 13, Rule 2). In seeking judgment in default of appearance, it is vital for the Plaintiff to be able to prove that the proceedings were served on the Defendant in accordance with the requirements of the Rules of the Superior Courts. To this end, the Plaintiff must file an affidavit of service of the summons in the Central Office before seeking judgment, and of the 28 day warning letter.

UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS In other types of claims, an application must be made to the court for judgment in default of appearance. The application is made by motion on notice to the Defendant. As the Defendant may, at this stage, be unrepresented by a solicitor, the application is dealt with as a motion for the sitting of the court. This is explained below. Before issuing the motion on notice to the Defendant, the Plaintiff must attend to the following matters: 1.

The court will let the unrepresented party know that the motion will take its place in the court list. 4. If there is no appearance by the unrepresented party at the sitting of the court, wait until the motion comes up for hearing in the court list and ask the registrar to call his name again before proceeding with the motion.

The judge concluded by commenting that: ...it is difficult to avoid the impression that the very fact that the particulars sought here are representative of current practice and that many of the requests in this and similar cases are either irrelevant or not permissible in law as particulars are nonetheless steadfastly advanced shows that many pleaders have simply gone astray in their enthusiasm to interrogate every possible detail of their opponent''s claim.
