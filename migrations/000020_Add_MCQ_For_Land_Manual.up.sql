A significant feature of land and conveyancing law as it has evolved has been the development of equitable jurisdiction by the courts in order to temper the harshness or rigidity of the common law. This has led to the important distinction between ''legal'' ownership of land and ''equitable'' or, as it is often referred to, ''beneficial'' ownership. A good illustration of this distinction is the trust under which the legal title to property is vested in a trustee (or trustees) who is obliged to hold or use the property entirely for the benefit of others, i.e. the ''beneficiaries''. Under the 2009 act''s provisions, the courts will remain free to exercise their equitable jurisdiction to develop the law in order to accommodate changing circumstances and conditions. While the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act, 2009 introduced many changes to the common law relating to land ownership and land transactions, it recognises that it will otherwise continue to operate and to develop. A consequence of this is that well-established concepts which are still of relevance in modern times are retained, though often subject to modifications set out in the Act.'),

Rather it is said that a person owns an interest or an estate in land. It enshrines the fundamental principle that what is owned is not the physical entity, the land, but rather some estate (giving substantial rights in respect of the land such as the right to occupy it) or interest (giving less substantial rights such as the limited use given by an easement comprising, for example, a right of way over a road on the land, or a profit prendre comprising a right to cut and take away turf) in the land. The full ownership of any particular parcel of land comprises these various estates and interests, including equitable interests, such as those existing under a trust of the land. Article 10.1 of the Constitution refers expressly to ''estates and interests'' (in the context of natural resources). How many of the various estates and interests will exist in respect of a particular parcel of land will vary from case to case. This model has a further consequence with regard to disputes over land. It is important to remember that a person''s title to land is always relative to the estates and interests held by other persons in respect of that land. Where a court determines that A, not has title to a piece of land, this decision is not conclusive against all other persons. A third party may be able to prove that he has a title that is superior to A''s. In other words, a decision between A and in favour of does not determine that A has ownership of the land in an absolute sense.'),

Therefore, an encroachment into the airspace above the land may constitute trespass as in Kelsen Imperial Tobacco (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd [1957] 2 334 where an advertising sign projecting over the plaintiff''s airspace amounted to trespass. In Woollerton and Wilson Ltd Richard Costain Ltd [1970] 1 All the jib of a crane trespassed into the plaintiff''s airspace. However, the effect of the maxim was qualified in Bernstein of Leigh (Baron) Skyviews & General Ltd (1978) 479 in which the High Court held that the owner was entitled only to such height above his land as was necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land and not indefinitely. There are many practical restrictions on the extent of ownership of land. For example, in Ireland section 55 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936 (as substituted by section 47 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988) provides that no action for nuisance or trespass will lie by reason only of the flight of an aircraft over the land, at a height that is reasonable in all the circumstances. In the 2009 Act, unless the context otherwise requires, "land" includes the airspace above the surface of land or above any building or structure on land which is capable of being or was previously occupied by a building or structure and any part of such airspace, whether the division is made horizontally, vertically or in any other way. In certain situations, the landowner''s rights to property below his land will also be qualified. In the case of Webb Ireland [1988] 353 the Supreme Court held that the State had a right of ownership over items of national importance and that such items were vested in the State as an attribute of its inherent sovereignty.

The word derives from the Latin verb tenere, meaning ''to hold''. Tenure should be distinguished from the concept of estate. Tenure governs the terms upon which the landowner holds the land and estate is the word used to determine the length of time for which the person can hold the land. From 1 December 2009 when section 9 of the 2009 Act came into effect feudal tenure, in so far as it survived, was abolished. However, the abolition of tenure does not disturb the position of the State as a residual owner of property in certain circumstances. For example, where a company is dissolved and its assets will continue to vest in the Minister for Finance pursuant to the State Property Act, 1954.

Legal freehold estates used to fall into three categories: Fee simple, which may be absolute or modified, Fee Tail and Life Estate. There are hybrid estates which share characteristics of both (fee farm grants and leases for lives renewable forever). Estates can exist in law or in equity. Freehold land is held by reference to an estate. A person who owns freehold land is said to hold a particular estate in the land. There are a number of different estates that can be held and it is important to be able to distinguish between them and to be aware of some of the technical rules that apply where a person wishes to convey his estate in the land to another. The 2009 Act retains the concept of estates but the only legal freehold estates in land that may be created or disposed of are those specified in section 11 such as the fee simple absolute or modified. All other estates in land will take effect as equitable interests only. Section 11 seeks to limit the amount of legal estates which may be created. It does not, therefore, limit the other estates which may be recognised in equity. Section 11 states that the only freehold estate that will be recognised as legal estates after the commencement of the section is the fee simple in possession. As explained below the fee simple is the largest estate which can be created and is closest to absolute ownership.'),

Where this formula is not used in a deed prior to 1 December 2009, then the conveyance grants a life estate only. The courts have held that words of limitation such as ''descendants'', ''relatives'' and ''issue'' are all ineffective to create a fee simple. Even where the words used in the conveyance indicate a clear intention to create a fee simple, the conveyance would not succeed in this unless the precise wording is used. However, where superfluous words are added this will not invalidate the grant of the fee simple. It is also important to remember that the appropriate words of limitation must appear in the operative part of the deed. Prior to the 2009 Act it would not suffice if A conveyed the estate to and in a subsequent clause in the deed were defined as "including and his heirs". An alternative to the words of limitation prescribed by the common law was provided by section 51 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881. The Act allowed that the words "in fee simple" would be effective to convey the fee simple estate in place of the phrase "and his heirs". However, this alternative method has been construed just as strictly by the courts and prior to the 2009 Act variations of the phrase did not constitute a valid conveyance of the fee simple. Where the conveyance is for sale first of all section 7 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881 introduced the use of the appropriate phrase "as beneficial owner". The implied covenants inter alia gave the purchaser who ended up with a life estate due to the use of incorrect words of limitation the right to have the deed rectified. Corporations have a distinct legal personality of their own and can own property or enter into contracts. With regard to a conveyance to a corporation aggregate (a corporation made up of two or more persons acting as a corporate body) words of limitation need not be used at common law and a conveyance to a limited company in its own name will be effective to convey the fee simple. A corporation sole is a corporation made up of one individual holding an office subject to perpetual succession, e.g. a Minister of State or the Archbishop of Dublin. The common law set down that a conveyance to a corporation sole must use the words "and his successors" in order to convey the fee simple estate. Where these words should have been used a life estate only will result. Also, it should be noted that the use of the words "and his heirs" has always been inappropriate in a conveyance to a corporation sole lest this might give the grantee a fee simple estate in his personal capacity. From the 1 December 2009 (in accordance with section 67 (1) and (2) of the 2009 Act) (a) a conveyance of unregistered land with or without words of limitation, or any equivalent expression, will pass the fee simple or such other entire estate or interest which the grantor had power to convey, unless a contrary intention appears in the conveyance; and a conveyance of unregistered land to a corporation sole by that person''s corporate designation without the word "successors" will pass the fee simple or such other entire estate or interest which the grantor had power to convey to the corporation, unless a contrary intention appears in the conveyance. Subject to section 68, these changes apply also to conveyances executed before 1 December 2009 but without prejudice to any act, acquisition or disposal of any interest before date as a result of the failure to use words of limitation in a conveyance or the application of the Rule in Shelley''s Case. Finally, with regard to inter vivos transactions, where the land in question is registered land under the provisions of section 123 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 there has never been a need for words of limitation. A transfer "to A" will also pass the fee simple interest or the entire estate over which the transferor had the power to transfer, unless a contrary intention appears in the deed. The courts have taken a less strict view of the requirement to use words of limitation in the context of a will. Even before 1838 all that was required was to show an intention to devise a fee simple in a will. Thus, phrases such as "To A for ever" and "To A absolutely" were deemed to be sufficient to vest a fee simple estate in the beneficiary. Then the Wills Act, 1837 (repealed by the Succession Act, 1965) provided that in a grant under a will the entire of the estate to which the testator was entitled at the date of his death passed to the grantee unless a contrary intention was evidenced in the will. These provisions were repeated in section 94 of the Succession Act, 1965. Therefore, after 1838 a grant simply "to A" has been sufficient to grant the fee simple estate if the testator held the fee simple at the time of his death.'),

Of course, if the event in question becomes impossible, then the determinable fee will become a fee simple absolute. In theory, where a grant like this is made, the grantor retains some interest in the property, and this is described as a possibility of reverter.

For example, conditions which seek to prevent or discourage the marriage of the grantee will be declared void by the courts. A condition which seeks to restrict the marriage of the grantee on religious grounds is more difficult to deal with, but the courts have tended to take the view that such conditions are void for uncertainty if not in contravention of public policy. Coughlan [1963] 245). See Corrigan above. Similar doubts have been raised in relation to conditions which direct the practice of a particular religious faith (McCausland Young [1949] 49 and Vaughan [1926] 67) or conditions which require residence in a particular property Fitzgibbon [1993] 1 520) or conditions framed in a so-called ''name and arms clause'' that require the grantee to use a specified family surname (Kearns and McCarnon Manresa Estates Limited, unreported'),

The fee tail is an estate of inheritance, but it does not confer absolute ownership. The fee tail is an estate which passes, under the ancient rules of heirship, to the direct descendants of the original tenant in tail. Historically a fee tail consists of a succession of life estates that has the potential to endure for ever according to the rules of primogeniture. The fee tail will only die out when the tenant in tail (the person in possession) dies without leaving any blood descendants. For as long as it lasts, the fee tail is inalienable. The property cannot be devised by a will and all that could be sold prior to the Settled Land Act, 1882 was the life estate of the person in possession. Section 58 of that Act gave inter alia a tenant in tail the powers such as overreaching on a sale conferred on a tenant for life under that Act. The Fines and Recoveries Act (Ireland) 1834 provided a mechanism whereby the tenant for life could break the fee tail and thereby sell the land free of the restrictions imposed by the fee tail. A "disentailing assurance" can be used to convert the fee tail into a fee simple. However, this Act was repealed by the 2009 Act. Prior to 1 December 2009 in order to effect this conversion, a present or future tenant in tail must execute the disentailing assurance and register it in the Central Office of the High Court within 6 months of its execution. The tenant in tail must obtain the consent of the protector of the settlement in the disentailing assurance. If there is no person nominated as protector, then the person currently in possession will be deemed to be the protector. Where the consent of the protector was not obtained, the alienation of the land by a tenant in tail would create a base fee only. This was an estate in fee simple where the entail are barred (the descendants of the tenant in tail) but where persons holding a reversionary interest were not. A base fee could be remedied by the tenant in tail (or his descendants) executing a fresh disentailing assurance properly. A third party who came into possession of a base fee could either buy out the interest of those entitled in reversion or claim an interest by invoking section 19 of the Statute of Limitations (possession of the land for 12 years after the death of the protector). The Fines and Recoveries Act enabled a person holding under a fee tail to dispose of the fee simple interest if the prescribed procedures were followed. He could sell to a third party or he could convey the estate to his own use so that he would enlarge his estate to that of a fee simple.'),

The section implements the recommendation that the fee tail estate should be abolished and converts a fee tail existing on the 1 December 2009 into a fee simple where the holder could have done so by executing a disentailing assurance. It did not convert any fee tail still subject to a ''protectorship'' or a fee tail after possibility of issue extinct. Where immediately before 1 December 2009 a person was entitled to a fee tail at law or in equity, or after that date, a person becomes entitled to a fee tail, a legal or, as the case may be, an equitable fee simple vests in that person on such commencement or on that person becoming so entitled provided any protectorship has ended. This is intended to avoid any interference with any existing interest in the land. Essentially, section 13(3) and (4) converts the interest of any party who would have otherwise been able to bar the entail under the 1832 Act into a fee simple interest. If the holder of an interest would not have been able to bar the entail, they do not automatically acquire the fee simple. After the commencement of the 2009 Act the holder of a base fee created by the failure to enrol the disentailing deed will have their interest also automatically converted into a fee simple. The second important requirement of the 1834 Act, above, was that the consent of the "protector of the settlement" be obtained. The protector was either the owner of a prior estate (e.g. a life owner where the disentailing tenant held the remainder interest only) or someone specified in the settlement creating the fee tail. Failure to obtain this consent led to the tenant in tail obtaining a base fee. By virtue of the qualification in section 13(3); ''provided the protectorship has ended'', the fee tail existing on December 2009 will not automatically be converted to a fee simple until the protectorship ends. The rationale behind the qualification was that automatic conversion should only take place when the tenant in tail could achieve this on his own by executing a disentailing assurance, which required the consent of the proctorship. Therefore, the tenant in tail will take the fee simple after the protectorship has ended. For example, the protector holds a life estate, the fee simple will vest automatically on his or her death. So too, a tenant in tail at the commencement of the act will take the fee simple automatically after the protectorship has ended. Section 13(4) of the 2009 Act does not include the estate of a tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct. The deals with the possibility of an "unbarrable" fee tail. This arose in the case of a fee tail "special", where the issue entitled to succeed to the entail were designated as the children of a specified spouse. If that spouse predeceased the tenant in tail and they had no children, there could be no issue capable of succeeding to itthe surviving tenant became tenant in tail "after possibility of issue extinct". The consequence is that the tenant in tail became, in effect, a tenant for life and those due to take on determination of the fee tail (as reversioners or remaindermen) had a vested interest. In light of this the legislation states that there should be no conversion of such a fee tail into a fee simple and the reversionary and remainder interests will remain vested and fall into possession on death of the tenant in tail. A fee simple which vests under this section is not subject to any estates or interests limited by the instrument creating the fee tail to take effect after the termination of the fee tail.

When the person entitled to the life estate dies the land will either pass to a person entitled in remainder or will revert to the original grantor (or his successors in title where he has died). A life estate is created by using the words "To A for life" or by default where the words of limitation used have been insufficient to create a fee simple. An estate pur autre vie can be created expressly by making a grant "To A for the life of or where a life tenant transfers his interest to another person so that the grantee holds an estate for the life of the original tenant (cestui que vie). The person holding a life estate will be subject to the common law doctrine of waste. The general rule is that a life tenant is not permitted to damage the lands or commit acts that adversely affect the land so that the interests of those succeeding him will be prejudiced. Where acts of waste are committed the persons entitled in reversion or in remainder will have an action in damages against the life tenant and can seek injunctive relief against the offending behaviour to prevent further acts of waste being committed. Prior to the 2009 Act, a life estate could be created or transferred by a deed of conveyance or by a will executed in accordance with the statutory provisions. After 1 December 2009, a life estate will no longer take effect as a legal interest in land, but this does not prevent the creation of a life estate as an equitable interest. The doctrine of waste is expressly dealt with in section 18 (4), which provides that conversion of a life estate into an equitable interest only does not affect a life owner''s liability for waste. Pursuant to Part 4 of the 2009 Act the legal fee simple in possession will be held by trustees on trust for the person or persons entitled to the life interest and the person or persons entitled in remainder.

A fee farm grant is a conveyance of a fee simple subject to a perpetual rent payable by the grantee to the grantor and also subject to covenants and conditions, characteristics which are more common to leasehold interests. The fee farm grant reflects the historical development of land law in Ireland. There are three types of fee farm grant. Certain fee farm grants arose from the feudal process of subinfeudation non obstante Quia Emptores. This means that in certain cases in Ireland the King granted land to his retainers and purported to exempt them from the restrictions that were imposed by the statute Quia Emptores 1290, repealed by the 2009 Act. This statute had prohibited the creation of new feudal relationships between lord and tenant. Where a person holds land under a fee farm grant non obstante Quia Emptores they hold it in the same capacity as a tenant under the feudal system. Therefore, they enjoy a fee simple estate in the land but are required to pay a perpetual rent to the grantor and his successors in title. Another type of fee farm grant arose under the provisions of the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849. This Act was passed to prevent the creation of leases for lives renewable for ever and to enable existing ones to be converted into a fee simple subject to rent payable to the landlord and the original covenants and conditions contained in the lease. Section 74 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 provides that any perpetually renewable leases that had not been converted under the 1849 Act were to be deemed fee simple estates from 1980 onwards, subject to the covenants. The third type of fee farm grant that has arisen in Ireland was made possible by the provisions of Deasy''s Act in 1860. One of the significant features of the Act is that it does not require a reversion on the part of the landlord in order to have a valid lease. Consequently, it is possible to create a lease under the provisions of Deasy''s Act that is not confined to a fixed term (and so, can last for ever) but is subject to the other usual characteristics of a lease such as the payment of rent and the observance of covenants and conditions. Section 12 of the 2009 Act prohibits the creation of legal or equitable fee farm grants in the future, i.e. from 1 December 2009. Where a fee farm grant is purported to be created, this will simply give rise to an estate in fee simple, free of any obligation for rent but subject to such of the covenants and conditions imposed by the grantor as are not inconsistent with an estate in fee simple. Section 12 (5) provides that existing fee farm grants will continue as legal interests. Both the fee farm grantee''s interest and the fee farm rent may be disposed of, although they are not listed in section 11 of the 2009 Act, which sets out a list of the legal interests in land that may be dealt with or disposed of. Existing Fee Farm Grants are registered as burdens on Part 3 of a Folio.'),

The Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877 was enacted with the aim of effecting a reorganisation of the jurisdictions of the Court of Chancery and the Common Law Courts. The Act had two important consequences: The Act enabled every judge of a superior court of justice to exercise both a common law and an equitable jurisdiction. Therefore, every litigant before a superior court of justice is entitled to the full benefit of the common law and equity no matter where his action is brought. In order that a judge might not find himself in a position of conflict between a common law remedy and an equitable remedy section 28(11) of the Act provides that "In all matters not hereinbefore mentioned in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of common law, with reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail."

It is most important to realise that where a trust has arisen, there is a separation between the legal and equitable estates in the land. The legal owner is entitled to exercise all his common law rights over the property, but equity requires him to exercise those rights for the benefit of the equitable or beneficial owner. A trust can be created expressly whereby the owner conveys the land to A to hold the land in trust for or, alternately, where the owner simply declares that he is holding the land in trust for another. The law will also recognise trusts that arise by implication in certain situations. Where a person makes a gift of land without consideration the law will presume that a resulting trust arises, that is, that the grantee is holding the land in trust for the grantor. The presumption will be rebutted by showing an intention on the part of the grantor that the grantee is to have absolute title to the property, i.e., that he is to enjoy both the legal and equitable interests. Similarly, where A and pool their assets and purchase a property, but the legal title is vested in A only, the law is likely to deem that A is a trustee holding the legal title for the benefit of himself and in shares proportionate to their respective contributions to the purchase price.'),

Common equitable interests include: (1) the interest of a beneficiary in a trust situation (2) the right of a person to enforce a restrictive covenant entered into by his predecessor in title (3) the right of a person to recover the legal estate in land on repayment of a mortgage (4) the right to enforce a mortgage that has not been created in accordance with the common law but simply by a deposit of the title deeds. There are said to be four main characteristics of an equitable interest. (1) A person who has an equitable interest in property is entitled to bring proceedings to recover ownership of property. (2) An equitable interest will bind a third party who takes possession of the property. (3) A person who has an equitable interest can sell or assign that interest to another party. It can also be mortgaged or devised in a will. (4) An equitable interest is also characterised by a degree of permanency and stability. There is a class of lesser rights which are recognised by equity, but which do not amount to equitable interests and which are described as mere equities. A mere equity is a personal claim that is capable of being converted into an interest through the successful conclusion of legal proceedings. It has also been defined as a right of an exclusively personal nature to pursue an equitable remedy. Where a person has a mere equity he does not have any estate or interest in the property itself. He has a right against persons only but it is a right that in certain circumstances may bind third parties who take the property with notice of the right. However, an equity is capable of being defeated by a subsequent purchaser who acquires an equitable interest in good faith and without notice. A useful example is a situation where a person has parted with his property under a transaction procured by fraud or undue influence. He does not have any equitable interest in the property but he has an equity in that he has a right to bring an action to have the transaction set aside. In the case of Allied Irish Bank Glynn [1973] 188 a father transferred his land to his son subject to the right of the father to reside in the property. The son was registered as owner of the property and entered into an equitable mortgage by depositing the land certificate with the plaintiff. Subsequently the father brought proceedings in which he claimed that his son had obtained the land by undue influence and he had the conveyance set aside. The Circuit Court ordered that the father be re-registered as the owner of the land. The bank had no knowledge of the father''s equity or the circuit court proceedings. When it commenced an action to enforce the equitable mortgage, the court held that the father''s right to have the deed set aside could not defeat the bank''s equitable interest being a mere equity (described as a chose in action). In his judgment Kenny explained that the main difference between an equitable interest and an equity is that an equity does not create or give any estate in land. It is a right against persons, and it is enforceable against those who were parties to the transaction from which it arose. Where a property is affected by an equitable interest it will not usually be disclosed on the title deeds. This means that a purchaser will need to make careful inquiries of the vendor in relation to the existence of any equitable interests or rights that affect the property. In determining whether or not a purchaser will be bound by an equitable interest, the concept of notice becomes important. In general, a purchaser of the legal estate is deemed to be bound by any equitable interest of which he or she had notice.'),

As regards notice, the rule developed by equity was that a bona fide purchaser for value of a legal estate or interest in land would take free of an equitable interest of which he had no notice. Similarly, a bona fide purchaser for value of an equitable interest without notice will take free of a mere equity.

In Northern Bank Ltd. Henry and others [1981] 1 the defendant was the legal owner of a leasehold interest in a house and he mortgaged this to the bank. However, the defendant''s wife had acquired an equitable interest in the lease by reason of the fact that she had contributed monies towards the purchase of the lease. The bank did not make a detailed investigation of the husband''s title and failed to discover the existence of the wife''s interest in the property. The Supreme Court held that the bank was fixed with constructive notice of the wife''s interest where its lack of knowledge was due to such careless activity as would not be expected in the circumstances from a reasonable man. In his judgment Henchy stated that the test as to what inquiries and investigations should be made is an objective test. It does not matter what a particular purchaser did in the particular circumstances but on what a purchaser ought reasonably to have done in the circumstances. The standard of conduct is that which is expected from a reasonable purchaser. Reasonableness in this context should be judged by reference to what should be done to acquire the estate or interest in question, not the motive or purpose of the particular purchase. He also stated that a reasonable purchaser would be expected to make such inquiries and inspections as would normally disclose whether the purchase would trench fraudulently or unconscionably on the rights of third parties in the property. In Somers Weir [1979] 94 the court held that, where facts at the command of a purchaser should have led him to inquire further but he refrained from doing so, equity fixed him with constructive notice of what he would have ascertained if he had pursued the investigation which a person with reasonable care and skill would have felt proper to make in the circumstances. Therefore, it is clear that a person who refrains from making inquiries as to the existence of any interests in the property, either through carelessness or to avoid being fixed with knowledge of inconvenient or embarrassing facts, may nevertheless be deemed to have had constructive notice of any such interests.'),

They must hold under the same tenure (leasehold or freehold) and they must hold the same estate in the land (fee simple or life estate). This principle is not breached if one tenant holds an additional interest in the land created at or before the creation of the joint tenancy. Title Both joint tenants must acquire their interest by the same title, either by the same deed, will or act of adverse possession. For example, it happens on occasion that some members of a family remain in possession of a property after the death of the owner. Over time those in possession will bar the interest of other members of the family who may have been entitled under the will or intestacy but did not remain in possession or take steps to have their title vested in them. In this situation the persons who remained in possession acquire a title as joint tenants and the right of survivorship will apply as between them thereafter.

Frequently a situation will arise whereby the co-owners will hold the legal estate or interest in the property as joint tenants, so that the right of survivorship applies, but that that legal estate or interest is held by the joint tenants for themselves in equity as tenants in common.

There are a number of circumstances in which equity will intervene and deem that legal joint tenants or a sole owner holds the legal title on trust for two or more persons as tenants in common. Example: A and may hold the legal title as joint tenants. However, if equity deems there to be a tenancy in common then they hold the legal title on trust for themselves as tenants in common in equity. If A dies, then becomes the sole legal owner by right of survivorship. However, equity will deem that in that situation holds the sole legal ownership in trust for himself and the persons entitled to A''s estate as tenants in common. Therefore, if the property were to be sold the proceeds of sale would have to be divided as between and the persons entitled to A''s estate. (a) Joint Tenants who make Equal Contribution Where the property is held by two or more persons as joint tenants and the purchase money has been provided by them in equal amounts then equity will presume that there is nothing to displace the common law position and will deem that they hold as joint tenants in equity as in common law. However, this presumption can be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention. In O''Connell Harrison [1927] 330 a number of shares were purchased and put in the names of two sisters and as joint tenants. became of unsound mind and was appointed to act as her committee at law. died and was survived by who died two years later. The personal representatives of claimed that since the shares were held jointly the right of survivorship applied and E''s estate was entitled to the entire interest in the shares. There was no evidence that the shares had been purchased other than by equal contributions and the judge assumed that this was the case. However, the court determined that the shares were held as tenants in common in equity because: (1) The sisters had inherited a business and other shares from their father and had executed a deed declaring that these were held as tenants in common (2) They had bought other shares as joint tenants but had executed deeds declaring these to be held as tenants in common (3) While was acting as the committee of she had declared that was entitled to half the shares and had asked that they be applied to her maintenance. Joint Tenants who make Unequal Contribution Where the legal title is held jointly by two or more persons, but they have contributed to the purchase money in unequal shares then equity will presume that they hold the property on trust for themselves as tenants in common in equity in shares proportionate to their contributions. Example: A and hold a property as joint tenants but A paid 2/3 of the purchase money. Equity presumes that A did not intend to make a gift of the disproportionate amount of the purchase money to A and are deemed to hold the legal title in trust for themselves as tenants in common, A to hold two undivided one third shares and to hold one undivided one third share. Sole Owner Where one person holds the legal title, but more than one person has contributed towards the purchase money then equity will presume that the sole legal owner holds the property on trust for himself and the other persons as tenants in common in proportion to the contributions. Equity presumes that the party who contributed towards the purchase price did not intend to make a gift but intended to acquire some interest in the property arising out of his contributions. In Jones Jones [1977] 2 All 231 a father bought a house for his son. His son moved in with his wife and children and paid the father one quarter of the purchase price. The father died and the property vested in the plaintiff who was the son''s stepmother. She brought proceedings to evict the son, but the Court of Appeal held that as he was a tenant-in-common in equity on foot of his contribution he could not be evicted. Mortgage Loans Where two or more persons lend money on the mortgage of a property in their joint names then equity will presume that they hold the mortgage as tenants in common in equity. It does not matter whether they made equal or unequal contributions to the amount of the loan. Equity presumes that in such a commercial transaction the right of survivorship was not intended to apply. Partnerships Similarly, where two or more persons hold property jointly arising out of a commercial partnership arrangement, then equity will presume that they hold it as tenants in common. This presumption can be rebutted in certain circumstances. In Reilly Walsh (1849) 11 22 two brothers entered into a business partnership. One of them became mentally ill and was hospitalised and neglected to take any further part in the business. On his discharge he purported to leave his share in the business to his beneficiaries under a will. The court held that since the brother had not really been involved in the business the assets of the business were held jointly in equity and the gift under the will could be defeated by the right of survivorship.'),

So, it was recognised that events could arise to "sever" the joint tenancy thereby destroying the right of survivorship, whereupon the parties would hold under a tenancy in common. This can arise in law and in equity. A joint tenancy can be severed and thereby converted to a tenancy-in-common in which case the right of survivorship ceases to apply. As stated above, no joint tenant can be regarded as having any distinct share of the property during a joint tenancy, but rather a potential share dependant on the number of his co-tenants alive and with the prospect of a larger share as the co-tenants die. Thus, on severance of the joint tenancy, the undivided share of each "new" tenant in common (the living former co-tenants), is an equal share in the property commensurate with the number of co-tenants surviving at the date of severance. There were two main ways of bringing about severance either at law, or in equity, namely; (a) By acquisition of some further interest in the property by one of the joint tenants, and Alienation of his interest in the property by one of the joint tenants. It is vital to note that the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act, 2009 made a radical change in the law in respect of the severance by acquisition or alienation. The Law Reform Commission was of the view that severance by one joint tenant unilaterally could operate unfairly as it could destroy the expectation on the part of the surviving joint tenant of becoming sole owner by virtue of the right of survivorship. Therefore, Section 30 of the 2009 Act protects joint tenancies for unilateral severance by alienation or acquisition. Section 30 prevents a joint tenant alienating his interest in the land or acquiring another interest in the land unless the consent of the other joint tenant or tenants is obtained. Any conveyance or acquisition without consent is void both at law and in equity, so that the joint tenancy remains in force. The consent must be ''prior consent and in writing''. Alternatively, the consent may be dispensed with under section 31 of the 2009 Act. Any person having an estate or interest in the land which is co-owned whether at law or in equity may apply to the court for an order dispensing with consent to severance of a joint tenancy as required by section 30 where such consent in being unreasonably withheld. It is appropriate to consider the severance of joint tenancies by acquisition or alienation by one of the joint tenants, bearing in mind the above requirement of prior written consent. The need for consent, unless dispensed with by court order, has operated only from 1 December 2009 but applies to any joint tenancy whenever created or coming into operation.'),

The 2009 Act does not interfere with the jurisdiction of the court to find that a joint tenancy at law has in fact been severed in equity in the kinds of situation outlined below. In Williams Hensman (1866) 1 546 Page-Wood stated at page 557: "a joint tenancy may be severed in three ways: in the first place, an act of any one of the persons interested operating upon his share . . . secondly, a joint tenancy may be severed by mutual agreement and in the third place there may be a severance by any course of dealing sufficient to intimate that the interests of all were mutually treated as constituting a tenancy in common". (a) Mutual Agreement Where one joint tenant agrees to convey his interest to the other this will effect a severance of the joint tenancy in equity even though no enforceable legal contract has been executed (Burgess Rawnsley [1975] 429). Course of Dealing If the acts and dealings of the joint tenants indicate an intention to treat the property as being held in common and not jointly then the court can infer from those acts and dealings an agreement to sever the joint tenancy. Contract by one joint tenant with a third party Where one joint tenant enters into a contract to sell his interest to third party, this in itself will not sever the joint tenancy. However, where the third party makes a part payment of the purchase price this was held in Tempany Hynes [1976] 101 to give rise to an equitable interest in favour of the purchaser in proportion to the amount of the purchase price paid. This in turn would have the effect of severing the joint tenancy in equity. It should be noted that from 1 December 2009 the entire beneficial interest passes to the purchaser on the making of an enforceable contract for the sale or other disposition of land under section 52 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009. Contract by all the Joint Tenants Where all the joint tenants enter into a contract to sell the property to a third party this in itself will not bring about a severance of the joint tenancy in equity Hayes'' Estate [1920] 1 207). In Byrne Byrne (unreported January 1980) two joint tenants entered into a contract for sale of lands to a third party. One of the tenants died before the sale was completed. The next of kin of the deceased claimed that the joint tenancy was severed by the sale of the land and that he was entitled to a half share of the purchase money.

The Defendant, in the course of his employment in the auctioneering business, learned of Mrs. Dolan''s death and of the apparent absence of any next of kin. He, it seems, broke into her home through the back door, in February, 1982, and has remained in possession of the premises, along with a Mary Grogan, since that date. The Plaintiff, as Chief State Solicitor and as personal representative, sought possession of the premises having extracted a grant of Letters of Administration in 2000. The Supreme Court interpreted the definition of ''State authority'' in section 2(1) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 as not including the Chief State Solicitor, notwithstanding that section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 puts him under the administration and control of the Attorney General (who is named expressly in the definition in section 2(1) of the 1957 Statute) and the longstanding practice of the Chief State Solicitor being the person to bring or defend proceedings on behalf of the State in respect of intestacies. The result was that the limitation period applied to the claim against the State as ultimate intestate successor in this case was the usual 12 years under section 13(2)(a) of the 1957 Statute, and not the 30 years applicable to a State authority under section13(1)(a). See Keating, The Recovery of Estates of Deceased Persons by a State Authority, Conveyancing & Property Law Journal (2013) 18 (3), 54-57. The limitation period is shorter (six years) where the interest forms part of the estate of a deceased person and a beneficiary has been dispossessed. This six-year period is extended under section 127 of the 1965 Act by a further period of 3 years in the case of shares of persons who are under disability. However, legal personal representatives are not barred except after the full period of 12 years. See Gleeson Feehan and anor 1991 ILRM 783. Not only will the owner of the land be statute-barred after the limitation period has run out and will not therefore be able to succeed in an action to recover possession of the land, but section 24 of the Statute provides that his title is extinguished.'),

In general, adverse possession is possession of the lands that is inconsistent with and in denial of the title of the true owner. Possession is not normally adverse if it is enjoyed with the consent of the true owner or by reference to a lawful title or some other lesser right, such as an easement. Where a person is given limited permission to use or occupy land but in fact exceeds this permission, it appears that he may be deemed to be in adverse possession, but this will depend upon the quality and extent of the acts by which the person exceeded the permission granted to him. This was one of the issues that arose in the case of Pye (Oxford) Limited Graham [2000] 676. In this case a farmer occupied land under a grazing licence. After the expiry of the licence he was given permission to take a cut of hay. In fact, he took a cut of hay but also continued to use the lands for grazing. In the High Court Neuberger explained the problem as follows: It seems to me that this argument raises this question: if the owner allows a person onto land for a specific purpose, and the person then carries on a different and unauthorised activity on the land, can the person rely on the unauthorised activity to justify the contention that he is enjoying adverse possession? In my judgment, the answer to that question must turn on the facts of a particular case. If a person is allowed onto the land for the sole purpose of grazing cows and he uses the land for the purpose of grazing sheep, no question of his enjoying adverse possession could arise during the period of the licence. He could be said to be in breach of the terms of his licence, but one could not sensibly say that he was enjoying adverse possession during its currency. On the other hand, if the owner permitted a neighbour to come onto his land whenever sheep escaped from the neighbour''s land, the use of the owner''s land by the neighbour for the purpose of arable farming for a period of 12 years could (depending on all the other relevant facts) give rise to a claim for adverse possession, even though the very limited licence granted by the owner may have been current during the whole of the 12 year period. The real question is not whether the claimant has exceeded his licence or permission but whether he has taken possession of the lands in an unauthorised manner.'),

It seems clear from the case law that there are two elements that need to be considered, a factual element and a mental element. The mental element is usually referred to as the animus possidendi, or the intention to possess and it involves the intention to exclude the true owner. The person must both subjectively intend to possess the lands in his own right, but he must also be able to point to acts on his part that manifest such an intention objectively. Of course, these acts will be the same acts that are relied on to prove the factual element of his possession as well. Use of the land without the requisite intention to possess is not adverse possession. The requirement for a manifested intention to possess the lands and assert exclusive control over the lands explains why the Courts have traditionally attached so much importance to the question of boundaries when considering whether there has been actual possession of the lands. Where there is strong evidence showing that the squatter has physically separated the lands from the remainder of the lands held by the true owner, the Court may allow a claim based on relatively slight acts of user. The physical incorporation of the lands with other lands owned by the squatter and the separation of the lands from those of the true owner displays prima facie an intention to possess. The control exercised by the squatter over the lands must be effective control. It must also be single and exclusive. In Powell MacFarlane (1977) 38 & 452 the Court held that ploughing and cultivating agricultural land was an act so drastic that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it showed an intention to possess and appropriate the land in question. In Scanlon Larkin [2011] IEHC 549, O''Keeffe ruled that a claim to title by adverse possession of part of commonage land failed because the claimants had failed to prove either the necessary intention to possess or exclusive physical control of the land at issue. The judge was not convinced that there had been much quarrying activity over the period claimed (other than taking the odd stones) or that there had been sufficient fencing to keep out animals or to withstand the elements in the very exposed area of land in question. Exclusivity is what distinguishes possession of the lands from mere occupation. Sometimes the distinction between them can be difficult to establish. Lord Denning suggested that the person in actual possession has effective control over the land. He is in charge of it. Nobody can use the land except with his permission or pursuant to a specific limited right, such as an easement. In Wilson Martin''s Executors [1993] 1 EGLR 178 the claimant had cut trees from the lands in question, cleared fallen timber and repaired the boundary fences. The Court of Appeal however, determined that repairing an existing fence was not sufficient to show an intention to the world at large to exclude the true owner; cutting trees to repair the fences was of no significance as the squatter had agreed to use the cut trees to repair the fences and taking timber for firewood was not probative in circumstances where the squatter believed at the time that the true owner would not object. In Convey Regan [1952] 56 Black held that a long period of cutting turf from a bog will not be evidence of possession of the lands. However, he said that a claimant could take possession of a bog by excluding others, for example by fencing off the bog, or putting up notices asserting his claim or proving that he had personally warned others off the lands. These acts would go beyond a mere right of turbary. The possession must be open and obvious to the extent that a true owner investigating the situation, or any other person, would know that the squatter was in possession of the lands in question. However, this does not mean that a squatter cannot acquire title against a true owner who is ignorant of his own title to the lands in question, once it is obvious that the squatter is in possession. The Irish case of Murphy Murphy [1980] 183 is authority for this proposition. In that case, Kenny found that a son was in adverse possession of lands over which his mother was the true owner, in circumstances where neither the son nor the mother was aware that the mother had been granted title to the lands under the will of her late husband. Where a person is in occupation of lands as an agent or employee, then he will be deemed to be in possession on behalf of his principal or his employer. Similarly, a squatter may be said to be in possession of lands even in a situation where he has let the lands to a tenant. This emphasises the difference between occupation and possession: The tenant is in occupation of the lands, but the squatter is said to continue in possession provided that he maintains sole and exclusive control over the lands, even in the capacity of a landlord. Most cases involving adverse possession are determined by reference to the factual circumstances in which the claimant was in possession of the lands in question. In the case of Doyle O''Neill (unreported, Appeal from 13 January 1995) O''Hanlon explained the following: In order to defeat the title of the original landowner, of opinion that the adverse user must be of a definite and positive character and such as could leave no doubt in the mind of a landowner alert to his rights that occupation adverse to his title was taking place. This is particularly the case when the parcel of land involved is for the time being worthless or valueless for the purposes of the original owner'),

The Statute sets out that the limitation period is extended in the case of persons under a disability and time will not begin to run against the person until he or she is relieved of their disability. If, on the date when any cause of action accrued to any person under a disability, then the action may be brought at any time before the expiration of six years from the date upon which the person ceased to be under a disability or died, whichever date occurs first (section 49 (1)(a) of the Statute). In the particular case of an action to recover land or money charged on land, the action will be barred after the expiration of thirty years from the date of accrual of the right of action to the plaintiff and no disability will extend this time limit (section 49 of the Statute). However, in respect of any claim to the estate of a deceased person, section 127 of the Succession Act, 1965 reduced the period set out in section 49 (1)(a) to three years. It will also be a good defence to show that during the limitation period, the squatter made an acknowledgement in writing of the title of the true owner. This will have the effect of stopping time running against the true owner and the limitation period will only commence again from the date of the acknowledgment. While the acknowledgement must be in writing under the provisions of section 53, there is no special form of words required. Whether or not a document amounts to an acknowledgement will be a matter of construction. In Doe Curzon Edmonds (1840) 6 & 295 a letter offering to purchase the lands from the true owner was construed as an acknowledgement of the better title of the true owner. In the often-quoted case of In Mitchell''s Estate [1943] 74 a letter which referred to an annuity charged on the lands but contained no admission or promise to pay was nevertheless treated as an acknowledgement within the meaning of the Statute.'),

This reasoning was followed in Ireland in the case of Cork Corporation Lynch (1995) 2 ILRM 598. However, in Durack Manufacturing Considine [1987] 677 Barron declined to follow this line of reasoning and he stated that the Statute quite clearly contains no reference to the intention of the true owner and the Court is not required to consider the intention of the true owner in determining whether there has been adverse possession. He stated that "There seems to be no reason in principle why the relevant provisions of the Statute of Limitations should be adapted to allow for the case of an owner who stands by and allows another to use his land merely because he wishes to use it for a specific purpose in the future". His view was that the only time it became relevant was in considering whether the squatter was aware of the intention of the true owner, in which case it might detract from the necessary animus possidendi. He stated that: Adverse possession depends on the existence of animus possidendi and it is the presence or absence of this state of mind which must be determined. Where no use is being made of the land and the claimant knows that the owner intends to use it for a specific purpose in the future, this is a factor to be taken into account. The principle has relevance only insofar as that when the factor is present it is easier to hold an absence of animus possidendi.

Nor had he shown the necessary factual possession or control as he had engaged in only intermittent and minimal activities in a concealed matter - none of these were sufficient to displace the ownership acquired by the airport authorities by virtue of the previous agreements. The final resolution of the ongoing applicability (if any) of the rule in Leigh Jack probably requires a comprehensive decision from one of the superior courts in respect of an appropriate case where ratio specifically turns on the issue. The judgment of Charleton in the recent Supreme Court decision of Ulster Investment Bank Limited Rockrohan Estate Limited [2015] IESC 17 is, arguably, also obiter (at [12]): Not all possession of land or premises, otherwise than by its owner, is adverse. In some cases it has been held that the intention of the owner as to the future use of the land may result in what would otherwise be the ordinary and complete use and possession of land by a stranger to the title not being adverse; Leigh Jack (1879) 5 264, Wallis''s Cayton Bay Holiday Camp Ltd Shell-Mex and Ltd [1975] 1 94, Cork Corporation Lynch [1995] 2 ILRM 598. This line of authority was criticised by Brady and Kerr as being "arguably subversive of the policy reasons which have undergirded successive statutes of limitations"; Brady and Kerr - Limitation of Actions edition, Dublin, 1994) at page 101. It was not followed by Barron in Seamus Durack Manufacturing Limited Considine [1987] 677. Such a principle, those commentators point out, would also make apparently overt acts of dispossession as may found adverse possession depend upon the subjective intention of the owner of the title to land. Some parcels of land, however, may be such as to constitute waste land, or land which is not capable of use or enjoyment, save perhaps on rare occasions. An example of this would be land beside or under a bridge that the owner used only for periods of inspection of the structure; Dundalk UDC Conway [1987] IEHC 3. Founding the concept of adverse possession is the principle that the party thereby claiming rights must not take or hold the land by force, by deception or with the permission of the owner of the legal title; or as lawyers of an earlier generation would have expressed it nec nec clam, nec precario. Charleton also alluded to the rule in Leigh Jack in similar terms in the Supreme Court decision in Dunne Iarnrod Eireann & Anor. [2016] IESC 47: While in some cases the title holder''s intention for future use has defeated what might ordinarily seem a complete form of occupation by the party claiming adverse possession, this is not determinative and may be no more than a factor; see Leigh Jack (1879) 5 264, Wallis''s Cayton Bay Holiday Camp Ltd Shell-Mex and Ltd [1975] 1 94, Cork Corporation Lynch [1995] ILRM 598, and to the contrary Seamus Durack Manufacturing Limited Considine [1987] 677. The matter does not now arise for decision. While Clarke preferred the latter case, counsel for CIÉ conceded that for much of the decade''s past, CIÉ had no particular plan for this field. Hence, no ruling is made as to future intended use on this appeal. Clarke correctly identified that mere occupation is not enough to ground a claim of adverse possession and that what is also required is that the ostensible adverse occupier of the land does so with the intention of excluding the original owner. The matter is put thus in Halsbury''s Laws of England, volume'),

As such, while a determinative decision in this jurisdiction from the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court would be helpful in terms of conclusively resolving this troublesome aspect of the law in relation to adverse possession, it certainly appears that there is a strongly expressed judicial preference from the superior courts towards viewing the issue of future intended use of land as merely representing a factor in the analysis as to whether the owner of land has been fully dispossessed in the eyes of the law.'),

The main provision of the Act is that the spouse who holds the legal and equitable interest in the family home cannot convey or transfer that interest to a third party without the prior written consent of the nonowning spouse. Section 3(1) of the 1976 Act provides as follows: "Where a spouse, without prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to sections (2), (3) and (8) and section 4, the purported conveyance shall be void". Accordingly, the essential requirement of the 1976 Act is that prior written consent is obtained from the non-owing spouse whenever there is a conveyance of a family home.

Section 4 of the 1976 Act makes provision for a Court in certain circumstances to dispense with the consent of a non-owning spouse, where the non-owing spouse omits or refuses to give the required consent under section 3(1).

Section 12 of the Act applies where the family home is a registered property and it allows the non-owning spouse to apply to the Land Registry for the entry of a note on the Register of his or her marriage to a person having an interest in the property. This clearly puts prospective purchasers on notice of the need to obtain the prior written consent of the applicant spouse. Under section 54 of the Family Law Act,1995 the non-owning spouse can give a general consent in writing to any future conveyance of any interest in a dwelling that is or was the family home of that spouse and where the deed for any such conveyance is executed after the date of that consent, the consent shall be deemed to be a prior consent in writing of the spouse to that conveyance. This is a useful provision in the case of a separation as it will relieve the owner of having to seek the consent of his or her spouse to a future disposition of the property.'),

Accordingly, whenever you are dealing with any one or more of the documents referred to above in relation to a family home prior written consent of the nonowning spouse should be obtained. The courts have held that where the non-owning spouse consents only to the contract for sale but not to the conveyance that the consent to the contract will be taken as consent to the subsequent conveyance of the property (Kyne Tiernan (unreported, 15 July 1980). It is nonetheless good practice to have the consent of the non-owning spouse endorsed on both the contract for sale and the subsequent conveyance. It appears from case law that further advances of monies on foot of an equitable mortgage will be deemed to be a conveyance within the meaning of the Act. In Bank of Ireland Purcell [1990] ILRM 106 the bank held an equitable mortgage over the property on foot of a deposit of title deeds prior to the operation of the Act. Subsequent to the 1976 Act the bank purported to make further advances on foot of this security. The court held that this constituted a further disposition of the interest of the mortgagor and that in the circumstances the prior consent of the non-owning spouse should have been obtained. A judgment mortgage is not a conveyance within the meaning of the 1976 Act and is regarded as a process of execution. There is nothing therefore preventing a judgment mortgage being registered against a family home without requiring the consent of a non-owning spouse (see Murray Diamond [1982] ILRM 113 and Containercare Wycherley [1982] 143). It is clear from the wording of section 1 of the 1976 Act that there is no requirement on a spouse to obtain the consent of his or her non-owning spouse before making a devise of the family home under a will. Whilst the 1976 Act fails to protect the non-owning spouse in this instance, on death of the owning spouse, the surviving spouse is protected by various provisions under the Succession Act, 1965.'),

The expression comprises, in addition, a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue ordinarily resides or, if that spouse has left the other spouse, ordinarily resided before so leaving". Accordingly, where a spouse whose rights are vulnerable has been forced to leave the property formerly occupied with his or her spouse, the property remains a family home for the purposes of the Act. The definition also includes a dwelling in which a spouse is residing, having been forced by the other spouse to leave the former family home. The rule of thumb to follow is ''once a family home, always a family home''. A property will only be a family home where the spouses are in actual residence in the property; however, it is not necessary that the parties be in an intimate relationship (see [1980] ILRM 257). In terms of where a married couple ordinarily reside, it is clear that a property in which they intend to reside is not protected by the Act (see National Irish Bank Graham [1995] 2 However, in practice the consent of the nonowning spouse should be sought and obtained whenever there is a doubt that the property may be a family home within the meaning of the 1976 Act. A ''dwelling'' is defined as any building or part of a building occupied as a separate dwelling and includes any garden or other land usually occupied with the dwelling, being land that is subsidiary and ancillary to it, is required for amenity or convenience and is not being used or developed primarily for commercial purposes, and includes a structure that is not permanently attached to the ground and a vehicle, or vessel, whether mobile or not, occupied as a separate dwelling (as amended by section 54(1) (a) of the Family Law Act, 1995). Where the family home is attached to other commercial property, for example in the case of a farm or a pub, it is possible to sell the other property without requiring the prior written consent of the non-owing spouse. In Havbell DAC Dias [2018] IEHC 175, the High Court clarified, once more, how the commercial use of a premises can exclude it from the definition of a "family home" as provided for in the section 2 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. In this case, the premises in question was also being used for short term commercial letting, and this function (which operated in tandem with the Defendant''s residential occupation of the premises) removed the premises from the scope of the 1976 Act. Costello said (at [51]- [52]): In addition, it is important to note that the tenancy agreement upon which she says she is entitled to occupy the property is a business letting agreement not a residential letting. The fact that she and her family reside in the premises does not make this a family home within the meaning of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. The definition of a family home means any building or part of a building occupied as a separate dwelling ... ''and is not being used or developed primarily for commercial purposes...'' In light of the fact that from 2015 to 2017 the premises operated as an AirBnB and her counsel accepts that there is a commercial aspect to the letting, it seems to me that the premises cannot be described as a family home within the meaning of the Act. Certainly, she has for a number of years profited from the use of the building as a guesthouse or hostel through the AirBnB website. This conclusion does not mean that the property has not been her residence as well as her place of business. It is the home where she lives with her husband who suffers from ill health..."'),

In accordance with the 1976 Act the consent of the non-owning spouse must be in writing and must be given prior to the execution of the conveyance. It is usual to have the non-owning spouse endorse the contract before any other party executes it as it is clear from case law that the conveyance cannot be ratified subsequently by the endorsement of the non-owning spouse. Auctions can present particular problems in this regard. Ideally the vendor should arrange to have the non-owning spouse present at the auction to endorse his or her consent on the contract, once the auction has concluded successfully. If this is not possible, the non-owning spouse should execute a separate consent prior to the auction. This should set out that the spouse consents to the sale of the property at auction and should stipulate a minimum sale price (usually the reserve). If the property does not achieve this price at the auction, the consent of the spouse will not be valid. As conveyancers came to terms with the need for consents, queries were raised about a number of different situations. It was, for example, held by the Supreme Court in Nestor Murphy [1979] 326 (where the vendors were the joint owners of the family home trying to resist an order for specific performance of the contract of sale) that the purpose of the 1976 Act precluded an interpretation of section 3(1) which would have the result of applying the provisions of that sub-section to a conveyance or a contract of sale, which had been executed by both spouses by mutual consent. At attempt to distinguish Nestor Murphy in circumstances where only one spouse derived a benefit from the transaction giving rise to the security was rejected by Hedigan in the High Court decision of Irish Nationwide Building Society Rafferty [2012] IEHC 352. In Jeffel (In Receivership) [2012] IEHC 279, Gilligan concluded that the reference in the definition of ''family home'' at section 2 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 Act to ''the spouse whose protection is in issue'' must be presumed to be a reference to the ''non-owning spouse'' as it would be absurd to find that a spouse vested with full legal and equitable title in a property could have recourse to the 1976 Act. Similarly, in the High Court decision of Allies Irish Banks plc Darcy [2015] IEHC 353, Keane followed the foregoing line of authority and held that the Second Named Defendant was incorrect in her assertions that, as a joint protagonists in the transactions which she later sought to impugn, she could rely on the protections afforded by the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 (in respect of a property which, the court noted, had, in fact, been "destroyed in an accidental fire some time ago and has not yet been reinstated"). Keane held that: Applying the foregoing analysis to the circumstances of the present case, it seems to me that the second named defendant is confusing the situation that appertained here, i.e. one in which she jointly engaged in transactions concerning the family home that she and her husband jointly owned, with the quite different one whereby a spouse, as sole owner of the family home, purports to deal with that property without the consent of the other non-owning spouse. Accordingly, satisfied that there is nothing in the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act1976 as applied to the circumstances of the present case which operates to prevent the bank from obtaining the Order that it now seeks for possession of the properties. On the other hand, the initial view that the 1976 Act did not apply where the vendor was a company was undermined by the case of Walpoles Ltd Jay (Unreported, High Court, 20 November 1981) with the result that it is necessary to look at each transaction to see if a family home is in fact involved such that a consent is necessary. The consent of the non-owning spouse must be informed consent. This means that the spouse must know what he or she is consenting to and what the consequences of the proposed conveyance or mortgage are (see Allied Irish Banks Finnegan [1996] 1 ILRM 401). There is an onus on a third party (purchaser or mortgagor) to ensure that the consent is a real consent once they are on notice that they are dealing with a family home (see Bank of Ireland Smyth [1993] 2 109). In practice it is advisable to ensure that the non-owning spouse has been advised of the consequences of providing their consent and that independent legal advice in relation to the issue of their consent has been obtained. A consent that has been obtained without the benefit of legal advice will be vulnerable to being set aside at a later date. It will be difficult to stand over consent where the same solicitor acts for both the owner and the non-owning spouse as a clear a conflict of interest arises.'),

It provides that where the conveyance is to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice that the consent is required or has not been given that the conveyance will be valid, however, where the purchaser for value is on notice that the consent of the spouse was required and has not been given, the conveyance will be void. Where the vendor does not disclose that he is conveying a family home the test in Reynolds Waters [1982] ILRM 335 will apply. In this case the Supreme Court stated that there is no principle that the prudent purchaser should not accept the uncorroborated statutory declaration of the vendor merely because the vendor has a financial interest in the transaction. If the statement later turns out to be inaccurate then the bona fide purchaser is protected by section 3 of the Act. However, if there were reasons why the purchaser''s solicitor should have doubted the veracity of the vendor''s statement then the situation might be different. A good example arose in the case of Somers Weir [1979] 94 in which the vendor made a statutory declaration that he was separated, that his wife had deserted him, and that the property was no longer a family home. He also stated that by virtue of a separation agreement his wife no longer had any legal or equitable interest in the property. In fact, the agreement made no mention of the property. The plaintiff purchased the house and then tried to obtain a mortgage. The bank required the consent of the wife and the plaintiff had to locate her, but she then refused to give her consent. The plaintiff brought an application under section 4 of the Act to dispense with the consent of the wife. The Supreme Court held that it could not dispense with consent where the conveyance had already been executed in order to mend the situation retrospectively. The Court also held that the plaintiff was fixed with constructive notice of the wife''s interest in the property and her statutory right to refuse her consent to the conveyance. In this case the plaintiff''s solicitor knew of the existence of the separation agreement but neglected to look for a copy of it. It appears therefore that if the purchaser knows that the vendor is married but separated, he is put on notice that the non-owning spouse may have an interest in the property.'),

However, section of the Family Law Act, 1995 introduced a six-year limitation period in respect of proceedings initiated under the Family Home Protection Act by a non-owning spouse seeking to declare a conveyance void. This is subject to the exception that a spouse who is in occupation of the family home from immediately before the expiry of the limitation period from the date of the conveyance in question up to the institution of proceedings will not be barred by the six-year rule. Example: executes a mortgage of the family home on 30 Jan 1990 without the prior written consent of Under the six-year rule she has until 29 Jan 1996 to commence proceedings to set aside the mortgage. However, if has been in actual occupation of the family home from a date prior to 30 Jan 1990, and unhappy differences arise between and after the 6-year period has elapsed, can still commence proceedings under the Family Home Protection Act to have the mortgage declared void. In practice, the vendor will usually furnish a Statutory Declaration setting out the position with regard to the family home. The Declaration will state either that the property is not a family home by reason of the fact that the vendor is not married or that no married couple resides in the property. Otherwise, the vendor will exhibit a copy of his marriage certificate confirming his marriage and the prior written consent of the spouse will be furnished. The Law Society Conveyancing Committee has recommended that it is best practice to use such Statutory Declarations to establish the position with regard to the family home. An alternative that is sometimes seen is a certificate by a solicitor stating that the property is not a family home. This is acceptable although not regarded as being the best evidence in this situation. Where a nonowning spouse seeks to challenge a conveyance on the basis of a failure to comply with the provisions of the 1976 Act, he or she is required to lodge a statement declaring the conveyance to be void in either the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds (as the case may be) and to register a lis pendens against the property. Therefore, to guard against this possibility the purchaser''s solicitor should conduct the appropriate searches in these registers to establish that the conveyance under which they are purchasing the property is not the subject of any such challenge. If the existence of a challenge is disclosed the sale cannot be completed and the purchaser will simply have to await the outcome of any legal proceedings.'),

The presumption does not appear to operate in respect of a gift from wife to husband and where this arises the husband will not acquire any equitable interest but will hold the property on resulting trust for his wife (in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention). Where the parties are not married then the presumption of advancement will not apply and where property is purchased by one person and transferred to another or into the joint names of himself and the other then a resulting trust will arise in favour of the person who provided the purchase monies (in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention). In the case of cohabitants, although the property may be held in joint names, if one person makes all of the mortgage repayments this may lead to him or her acquiring an increased beneficial interest in the property to an extent proportionate to their contributions (in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention).'),

Indirect financial contributions arise where one person has contributed their income towards a ''family fund'' from which bills and other household expenses are paid. In M.G. R.D. (unreported 28 April 1981) the family home had been purchased in the sole name of the husband and he had made all the mortgage repayments and other expenses associated with the house. The wife had used her salary to pay for a car, which was used by both spouses, and to buy items for the house. Keane held that any such contributions would only give rise to an equitable interest where there is evidence before the court of a common intention to this effect. In the absence of any such agreement he dismissed the claim. However, in [1981] ILRM 202 Finlay commented on the value of indirect contributions that where a wife contributes to a general family fund thus releasing her husband from an obligation to discharge liabilities from that fund and permitting him to repay mortgage instalments, she will in the absence of proof of an inconsistent agreement or arrangement be entitled to an equitable share in the property. The Supreme Court approved this reasoning in McC. McC. [1984] IESC 1. In that case the wife had contributed towards the purchase of the previous family home and when it was sold the proceeds were put towards the cost of furniture in the new home. The new home was purchased by the husband''s employers and secured by a mortgage. The Court held that the wife had not contributed either directly or indirectly towards the purchase of the second house. However, the Court affirmed that where a wife makes indirect contributions such as applying her earnings to a general family fund, the court will in the absence of an agreement to the contrary infer a trust in favour of the wife on the grounds that she has relieved the husband of the financial burden he incurred in purchasing the house.'),

In [1981] ILRM 2002 Finlay took the view that an equitable interest cannot arise in such circumstances unless the contributor can establish that it was specifically agreed or that she was led to believe by the surrounding circumstances that she would receive an equitable interest in return for her contributions. In the absence of this, any improvements could only be compensated in money terms. In N.A.D. T.D. [1985] ILRM 153 the wife gave evidence that she had contributed to over one-third of the building costs of the family home. However, Barron confirmed that no trust arose in her favour and commented that since the legal and beneficial ownership of the property was already vested in her husband, he was entitled to take the benefit of the improvements in the absence of any agreement to the contrary. (He also considered whether it would be appropriate to impose a constructive trust but felt that the husband had not behaved in a manner that would allow that remedy to be granted). In [1992] 2 116 a plaintiff widow claimed an equitable interest in the family home on a number of grounds. She had applied her earnings from part time work to a family fund. She had managed a number of bed-sitter flats in part of the property, the rental income from which had been applied directly or indirectly towards the mortgage repayments. She had also contributed indirectly to a mortgage that had been taken out to finance an extension to the property.

In this case the testator under his will made the following bequest "my beloved wife shall have her diet and lodging in this house as long as the lease shall last provided that she will remain in it with my aforesaid nephew Patrick Ryan". The widow lived there for some time but left when the nephew got married. She later returned and claimed an entitlement to be provided for in accordance with the terms of her late husband''s will. The Court held that she was entitled to the relief sought. The court would satisfy the obligation in the will unless the widow had induced a belief in the nephew that she was not going to return, so causing him to act to his detriment. Brady held that if the court could not compel the maintenance then it would compel the payment of a proper sum to provide it. In National Bank Keegan [1931] 344 the court was concerned with an exclusive right to reside in two specified rooms in a house, together with a right of maintenance. The right was granted by an informal written memorandum. The Supreme Court held that this created an equitable life estate in the grantee that took priority to an equitable mortgage as the mortgagee was on notice of the right of residence. The Supreme Court noted that a legal life estate would have ensued had the agreement been granted by deed or will. Kennedy followed Ryan Ryan in holding that a general right of residence charged on a holding is a right capable of being valued in monies calculated as an annual sum. However, it is worth noting the dissenting judgment of Murnaghan who said that if the right was construed as a life estate then the aunt would have the right to let the rooms and this was clearly not envisaged when a right of residence is granted. His view was that the right of residence was a purely personal use in the nature of a licence. In Kelaghan Daly [1913] 2 328 a mother transferred lands to her son who covenanted that he would "henceforth clothe support maintain and keep the donor and her daughter during their joint lives and for the life of the survivor of them and that he would permit them to use and enjoy the dwelling house on the farm for their lives". Boyd deemed that the right of residence and maintenance constituted a vendor''s lien over the property since it comprised the consideration for the transfer. The court made an order for the sale of the lands on application by a judgment mortgagee but subject to the covenant. In Atkins Atkins [1976] ILRM 62 Kenny held that where a testator had bequeathed a property to the use of his wife "during her widowhood and as long as she shall desire to reside therein" this gave rise to a life estate but that this would determine if she ceased to reside in the property. Unlike the previous case the right of residence extended over the entire property. In the case of Lahiffe Hecker (unreported 28 April 1994) the property was bequeathed to a son and three daughters with a proviso that "the only unmarried daughter shall have a right of residence in the house until she marries". The children agreed to sever the joint tenancy and hold as tenants in common while the only unmarried daughter was the only child who lived in the house. An issue arose when she sought to have the other children excluded from the house. Lynch held that a right of residence is in the nature of a charge affecting the interests of all of the parties in the property. He held that the other children were entitled to occupy the property but not to the extent that they would render the daughter''s right of residence impossible. He stated that the daughter could not seek to exclude the other children as she was not entitled to the exclusive use of any part of the house. In order for her to practically enjoy her right of residence she was allowed to have exclusive use of one of three bedrooms. He also held that if the parties decided to sell the house then the court would have to place a value on the right of residence, and it would be paid for out of proceeds of sale. Section 11(2)(c)(iii) of the 2009 Act recognises that a right of residence will survive as a legal interest in the manner of a licence, charge or a lien in favour of the grantee affecting the estate of the legal owner of the property in question. However, where there is an exclusive right of residence granted over the whole of a property, then this will be regarded as being analogous to a life estate and the property would be regarded as being settled on the grantee of the right of residence for his or her life.

The testator left a cottage in Crumlin to a married daughter subject to a right of residence in favour of another daughter, the plaintiff. The married daughter was registered as owner and the right of residence registered as a burden on the folio. The owner died having left the cottage to her son. He carried out improvements on the cottage and then sought to extinguish the right of residence. The plaintiff left the house to live elsewhere but later sought an injunction to restrain the defendant interfering with the right. Lavan said that the right had not been abandoned in a situation where the plaintiff had been forced out. He said that the right is not abandoned by an absence of any length. The right cannot be varied by the owner. The right may be abandoned voluntarily if it is done expressly and freely or by effluxion of time. However, a court would require strong evidence from a party seeking to defeat such a right while the right remains a burden on the folio and in the absence of an express agreement that discloses an intention to abandon. In relation to the value of the right of residence he held that because the right of residence is an ongoing one its financial equivalent should be determined on a periodic basis. The value of a right of residence should not be estimated on a capitalised basis since this would be to treat the right in the same manner as a life estate. The court should be able to embark upon such a valuation either under its equitable jurisdiction or at the behest of the parties. The court should look at the rental value of equivalent property elsewhere or the cost one would reasonably expect a relative to contribute in respect of the right to reside. The valuation of a right of residence is not compensatory. The defendant''s absence of means should be taken into account. The infringement of a right of residence is an act that warrants substantial damages in most cases. More recently in the case of Bracken Byrne [2005] IEHC 180 Clarke considered a case where the plaintiff enjoyed a right of residence, maintenance and support. He held that the primary entitlement of a beneficiary of a right was to have that right enforced and therefore the beneficiary should be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief to ensure that they could enjoy that right. He found that there could be circumstances, however, where that would not be practical or reasonable and, in such circumstances, the appropriate form of redress would be to value the rights and direct that the beneficiary be paid for those rights rather than to grant injunctive relief. Clarke also held that, in addition to proving that it had become unreasonable to require the beneficiary to be content with the exercise of the rights due to a breakdown in a quasi-family relationship between the beneficiary and the owner, it was also necessary that the balance of responsibility for that situation lay with the owner in order that those rights be converted to money. The ability of the defendant to pay the sums thus awarded would also be an important factor in the exercise of the court''s discretion as to whether the remedy should be by way of injunctive relief or the payment of the sum of money in lieu thereof.'),

The important attribute of easements and profits prendre is that both the benefit and the burden of easements will pass with the lands and will bind the successors in title of the parties who created them. A profit prendre is the right to go onto someone else''s land and to take from it something which belongs on it naturally, such as the right to mine or quarry, cut timber or turf, graze animals on grass, fish and hunt wild game. Whilst often enjoyed by neighbouring landowners, profit prendre may also exist "in gross", i.e. it does not need to attach to or benefit adjoining land. Unlike profit prendre easements cannot exist in gross.'),

The lands must be neighbouring but not necessarily contiguous. In Pugh Savage [1970] 2 373 a right of way existed even though both tenements were separated by an intervening plot of land. In Latimer Official Cooperative Society (1885) 16 305 where there were three terraced houses in a row it was held that a right of support existed between the first and third house. It is an important principle that an easement cannot be held in gross. This means that a person who does not hold an estate in land cannot be entitled to exercise an easement. 1.1.2 The right must accommodate the dominant tenement and be a burden to the servient tenement An easement must not merely benefit the owner of the dominant land, but it must actually improve the dominant land in some respect, whether in terms of convenience, utility or amenity. It can be difficult to determine whether or not a right benefits the land. In Hill Tupper (1863) 2 H&C 121 the owner of a boat yard had been granted a lease of land adjoining the canal together with "the exclusive right or liberty" to use and hire out pleasure boats. This was not deemed to be an easement as the benefit accrued to the business and not directly to the land. However, in Moody Steggles (1879) 12 Ch.D 261 it was held that the right of the owner of a public house to place a sign on a neighbouring premises was capable of being an easement. An easement cannot exist where it interferes with the servient tenement to the extent that the owner cannot enjoy exclusive occupation of his property. Therefore, a general right to park cars in an area can be an easement but a right to park in a particular place cannot (London and Blenheim Estates Ltd Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd [1993] 4 All 157). 1.1.3 The dominant and servient tenements must not be owned and occupied by the same person The dominant and servient tenements must be held under separate ownership. Clearly a person cannot enjoy an easement over his own land since he could not enforce such a right against himself. However, it is not a bar to the recognition of an easement that the freehold interest in the tenements are owned by the same person as long as they are occupied by different persons. Therefore, a tenant may acquire an easement against a tenement owned and occupied by his landlord. (Hanna Pollock [1900] 2 664). 1.1.4 The right must be capable of being the subject matter of a grant. There are two aspects to this requirement. In the first place it means that the right should be sufficiently clear and precise to enable it to be enforced. Secondly, the courts will tend to enforce only those rights that have traditionally been recognised as easements in the past. (a) Clarity and Precision Where the extent of the right claimed is difficult or impossible to define it will not be enforceable and it is unlikely to be recognised as an easement. In Pwllbach Colliery Ltd Woodman [1915] 634 the owners of a coal mine were not able to enforce a right to allow coal dust to blow onto neighbouring lands as the servient tenement could not be clearly identified. In the case of Phipps Pears (1965) 1 76 it was stated that a right to a view cannot be granted in the form of an easement as it is too vague. In general, a court is unlikely to recognise a particular right as an easement if the exercise of the right involves expenditure by the servient owner, if it is purely restrictive or negative in nature or if the exercise of the right is contrary to public policy, for example, a right to release a pollutant onto lands. In Regis Property Ltd. Redman [1956] 2 612 the Court refused to recognise a right to a supply of hot water as an easement on the basis that such a right would require expenditure on the part of the servient owner. Historical Precedent It has been stated that incidents of a novel kind cannot be devised and attached to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner, per Brougham in Keppell Bailey (1834) 2 My & 517. However, the more pragmatic approach of Lord Leonard in Dyce Lady James Hay (1852) 1 Macq. held that the category of servitudes and easements must alter and expand with the changes that take place in the circumstances of mankind. Nevertheless, it will be difficult to enforce a right that has not previously been recognised as an easement. In Ellenborough Park [1956] 131 the right to walk in a park adjacent to property was recognised as the right was more than mere personal enjoyment and was held to enhance and accommodate the property.'),

An easement created by deed confers legal rights upon the grantee. In the case of an express grant it appears that until 1 December 2009 appropriate words of limitation must be used or the grantee may only get an easement for life (Gannon Walsh [1996] 3 245) Where a grant of an easement does not comply with the essential formalities to create a legal title to the easement, it can nevertheless create an easement or a profit in equity if it is given for value and is evidenced in writing or by acts of part performance. Equity will then treat the arrangement as a specifically enforceable agreement and the grantor will be estopped from denying the grant of the easement or profit (McManus Cooke (1887) 35 681). The usual way for a person to reserve an easement is to have the grantee execute the conveyance under which he is acquiring the lands to give effect to the reservation as a ''re-grant'' (Durham and Sutherland Railway Walker (1842) 2 940). An express grant or reservation will be construed against the grantee. It is an important principle that the grantor will not be allowed to derogate from his grant, i.e., to subsequently act in a manner that would impede or frustrate the performance of the right (Kennedy Elkinson [1937] 71 ILTR 153).'),

In Woollerton and Wilson Ltd Richard Costain Ltd [1970] 1 All the jib of a crane trespassed into the plaintiff''s airspace. However, the effect of the maxim was qualified in Bernstein of Leigh (Baron) Skyviews & General Ltd (1978) 479 in which the High Court held that the owner was entitled only to such height above his land as was necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land and not indefinitely. There are many practical restrictions on the extent of ownership of land. For example, in Ireland section 55 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936 (as substituted by section 47 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988) provides that no action for nuisance or trespass will lie by reason only of the flight of an aircraft over the land, at a height that is reasonable in all the circumstances. In the 2009 Act, unless the context otherwise requires, "land" includes the airspace above the surface of land or above any building or structure on land which is capable of being or was previously occupied by a building or structure and any part of such airspace, whether the division is made horizontally, vertically or in any other way. In certain situations, the landowner''s rights to property below his land will also be qualified. In the case of Webb Ireland [1988] 353 the Supreme Court held that the State had a right of ownership over items of national importance and that such items were vested in the State as an attribute of its inherent sovereignty.

The fee tail is an estate of inheritance, but it does not confer absolute ownership. The fee tail is an estate which passes, under the ancient rules of heirship, to the direct descendants of the original tenant in tail. Historically a fee tail consists of a succession of life estates that has the potential to endure for ever according to the rules of primogeniture. The fee tail will only die out when the tenant in tail (the person in possession) dies without leaving any blood descendants. For as long as it lasts, the fee tail is inalienable. The property cannot be devised by a will and all that could be sold prior to the Settled Land Act, 1882 was the life estate of the person in possession. Section 58 of that Act gave inter alia a tenant in tail the powers such as overreaching on a sale conferred on a tenant for life under that Act. The Fines and Recoveries Act (Ireland) 1834 provided a mechanism whereby the tenant for life could break the fee tail and thereby sell the land free of the restrictions imposed by the fee tail. A "disentailing assurance" can be used to convert the fee tail into a fee simple. However, this Act was repealed by the 2009 Act. Prior to 1 December 2009 in order to effect this conversion, a present or future tenant in tail must execute the disentailing assurance and register it in the Central Office of the High Court within 6 months of its execution. The tenant in tail must obtain the consent of the protector of the settlement in the disentailing assurance. If there is no person nominated as protector, then the person currently in possession will be deemed to be the protector. Where the consent of the protector was not obtained, the alienation of the land by a tenant in tail would create a base fee only. This was an estate in fee simple where the entail are barred (the descendants of the tenant in tail) but where persons holding a reversionary interest were not. A base fee could be remedied by the tenant in tail (or his descendants) executing a fresh disentailing assurance properly. A third party who came into possession of a base fee could either buy out the interest of those entitled in reversion or claim an interest by invoking section 19 of the Statute of Limitations (possession of the land for 12 years after the death of the protector). The Fines and Recoveries Act enabled a person holding under a fee tail to dispose of the fee simple interest if the prescribed procedures were followed. He could sell to a third party or he could convey the estate to his own use so that he would enlarge his estate to that of a fee simple.'),

It did not convert any fee tail still subject to a ''protectorship'' or a fee tail after possibility of issue extinct. Where immediately before 1 December 2009 a person was entitled to a fee tail at law or in equity, or after that date, a person becomes entitled to a fee tail, a legal or, as the case may be, an equitable fee simple vests in that person on such commencement or on that person becoming so entitled provided any protectorship has ended. This is intended to avoid any interference with any existing interest in the land. Essentially, section 13(3) and (4) converts the interest of any party who would have otherwise been able to bar the entail under the 1832 Act into a fee simple interest. If the holder of an interest would not have been able to bar the entail, they do not automatically acquire the fee simple. After the commencement of the 2009 Act the holder of a base fee created by the failure to enrol the disentailing deed will have their interest also automatically converted into a fee simple. The second important requirement of the 1834 Act, above, was that the consent of the "protector of the settlement" be obtained. The protector was either the owner of a prior estate (e.g. a life owner where the disentailing tenant held the remainder interest only) or someone specified in the settlement creating the fee tail. Failure to obtain this consent led to the tenant in tail obtaining a base fee. By virtue of the qualification in section 13(3); ''provided the protectorship has ended'', the fee tail existing on December 2009 will not automatically be converted to a fee simple until the protectorship ends. The rationale behind the qualification was that automatic conversion should only take place when the tenant in tail could achieve this on his own by executing a disentailing assurance, which required the consent of the proctorship. Therefore, the tenant in tail will take the fee simple after the protectorship has ended. For example, the protector holds a life estate, the fee simple will vest automatically on his or her death. So too, a tenant in tail at the commencement of the act will take the fee simple automatically after the protectorship has ended. Section 13(4) of the 2009 Act does not include the estate of a tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct. The deals with the possibility of an "unbarrable" fee tail. This arose in the case of a fee tail "special", where the issue entitled to succeed to the entail were designated as the children of a specified spouse. If that spouse predeceased the tenant in tail and they had no children, there could be no issue capable of succeeding to itthe surviving tenant became tenant in tail "after possibility of issue extinct". The consequence is that the tenant in tail became, in effect, a tenant for life and those due to take on determination of the fee tail (as reversioners or remaindermen) had a vested interest. In light of this the legislation states that there should be no conversion of such a fee tail into a fee simple and the reversionary and remainder interests will remain vested and fall into possession on death of the tenant in tail. A fee simple which vests under this section is not subject to any estates or interests limited by the instrument creating the fee tail to take effect after the termination of the fee tail.

The person holding a life estate will be subject to the common law doctrine of waste. The general rule is that a life tenant is not permitted to damage the lands or commit acts that adversely affect the land so that the interests of those succeeding him will be prejudiced. Where acts of waste are committed the persons entitled in reversion or in remainder will have an action in damages against the life tenant and can seek injunctive relief against the offending behaviour to prevent further acts of waste being committed. Prior to the 2009 Act, a life estate could be created or transferred by a deed of conveyance or by a will executed in accordance with the statutory provisions. After 1 December 2009, a life estate will no longer take effect as a legal interest in land, but this does not prevent the creation of a life estate as an equitable interest. The doctrine of waste is expressly dealt with in section 18 (4), which provides that conversion of a life estate into an equitable interest only does not affect a life owner''s liability for waste. Pursuant to Part 4 of the 2009 Act the legal fee simple in possession will be held by trustees on trust for the person or persons entitled to the life interest and the person or persons entitled in remainder. The trustees will have full powers to deal with the land but will be subject to the interests of the persons entitled to the beneficial interest. This is further discussed in the chapter on Trusts.'),

A fee farm grant is a conveyance of a fee simple subject to a perpetual rent payable by the grantee to the grantor and also subject to covenants and conditions, characteristics which are more common to leasehold interests. The fee farm grant reflects the historical development of land law in Ireland. There are three types of fee farm grant. Certain fee farm grants arose from the feudal process of subinfeudation non obstante Quia Emptores. This means that in certain cases in Ireland the King granted land to his retainers and purported to exempt them from the restrictions that were imposed by the statute Quia Emptores 1290, repealed by the 2009 Act. This statute had prohibited the creation of new feudal relationships between lord and tenant. Where a person holds land under a fee farm grant non obstante Quia Emptores they hold it in the same capacity as a tenant under the feudal system. Therefore, they enjoy a fee simple estate in the land but are required to pay a perpetual rent to the grantor and his successors in title. Another type of fee farm grant arose under the provisions of the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849. This Act was passed to prevent the creation of leases for lives renewable for ever and to enable existing ones to be converted into a fee simple subject to rent payable to the landlord and the original covenants and conditions contained in the lease. Section 74 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 provides that any perpetually renewable leases that had not been converted under the 1849 Act were to be deemed fee simple estates from 1980 onwards, subject to the covenants. The third type of fee farm grant that has arisen in Ireland was made possible by the provisions of Deasy''s Act in 1860. One of the significant features of the Act is that it does not require a reversion on the part of the landlord in order to have a valid lease. Consequently, it is possible to create a lease under the provisions of Deasy''s Act that is not confined to a fixed term (and so, can last for ever) but is subject to the other usual characteristics of a lease such as the payment of rent and the observance of covenants and conditions. Section 12 of the 2009 Act prohibits the creation of legal or equitable fee farm grants in the future, i.e. from 1 December 2009. Where a fee farm grant is purported to be created, this will simply give rise to an estate in fee simple, free of any obligation for rent but subject to such of the covenants and conditions imposed by the grantor as are not inconsistent with an estate in fee simple. Section 12 (5) provides that existing fee farm grants will continue as legal interests. Both the fee farm grantee''s interest and the fee farm rent may be disposed of, although they are not listed in section 11 of the 2009 Act, which sets out a list of the legal interests in land that may be dealt with or disposed of. Existing Fee Farm Grants are registered as burdens on Part 3 of a Folio.'),

The beneficiary is said to hold the equitable or beneficial interest in the land. Where a trust has arisen, the legal owner holds any profit or benefit accruing from his ownership on behalf of the beneficiary and he is not entitled to convert any such profit or benefit to his own use. It is most important to realise that where a trust has arisen, there is a separation between the legal and equitable estates in the land. The legal owner is entitled to exercise all his common law rights over the property, but equity requires him to exercise those rights for the benefit of the equitable or beneficial owner. A trust can be created expressly whereby the owner conveys the land to A to hold the land in trust for or, alternately, where the owner simply declares that he is holding the land in trust for another. The law will also recognise trusts that arise by implication in certain situations. Where a person makes a gift of land without consideration the law will presume that a resulting trust arises, that is, that the grantee is holding the land in trust for the grantor. The presumption will be rebutted by showing an intention on the part of the grantor that the grantee is to have absolute title to the property, i.e., that he is to enjoy both the legal and equitable interests. Similarly, where A and pool their assets and purchase a property, but the legal title is vested in A only, the law is likely to deem that A is a trustee holding the legal title for the benefit of himself and in shares proportionate to their respective contributions to the purchase price.'),

Common equitable interests include: (1) the interest of a beneficiary in a trust situation (2) the right of a person to enforce a restrictive covenant entered into by his predecessor in title (3) the right of a person to recover the legal estate in land on repayment of a mortgage (4) the right to enforce a mortgage that has not been created in accordance with the common law but simply by a deposit of the title deeds. There are said to be four main characteristics of an equitable interest. (1) A person who has an equitable interest in property is entitled to bring proceedings to recover ownership of property. (2) An equitable interest will bind a third party who takes possession of the property. (3) A person who has an equitable interest can sell or assign that interest to another party. It can also be mortgaged or devised in a will. (4) An equitable interest is also characterised by a degree of permanency and stability. There is a class of lesser rights which are recognised by equity, but which do not amount to equitable interests and which are described as mere equities. A mere equity is a personal claim that is capable of being converted into an interest through the successful conclusion of legal proceedings. It has also been defined as a right of an exclusively personal nature to pursue an equitable remedy. Where a person has a mere equity he does not have any estate or interest in the property itself. He has a right against persons only but it is a right that in certain circumstances may bind third parties who take the property with notice of the right. However, an equity is capable of being defeated by a subsequent purchaser who acquires an equitable interest in good faith and without notice. A useful example is a situation where a person has parted with his property under a transaction procured by fraud or undue influence. He does not have any equitable interest in the property but he has an equity in that he has a right to bring an action to have the transaction set aside. In the case of Allied Irish Bank Glynn [1973] 188 a father transferred his land to his son subject to the right of the father to reside in the property. The son was registered as owner of the property and entered into an equitable mortgage by depositing the land certificate with the plaintiff. Subsequently the father brought proceedings in which he claimed that his son had obtained the land by undue influence and he had the conveyance set aside. The Circuit Court ordered that the father be re-registered as the owner of the land. The bank had no knowledge of the father''s equity or the circuit court proceedings. When it commenced an action to enforce the equitable mortgage, the court held that the father''s right to have the deed set aside could not defeat the bank''s equitable interest being a mere equity (described as a chose in action). In his judgment Kenny explained that the main difference between an equitable interest and an equity is that an equity does not create or give any estate in land. It is a right against persons, and it is enforceable against those who were parties to the transaction from which it arose. Where a property is affected by an equitable interest it will not usually be disclosed on the title deeds. This means that a purchaser will need to make careful inquiries of the vendor in relation to the existence of any equitable interests or rights that affect the property. In determining whether or not a purchaser will be bound by an equitable interest, the concept of notice becomes important. In general, a purchaser of the legal estate is deemed to be bound by any equitable interest of which he or she had notice.'),

Equity will protect and enforce the equitable rights against all purchasers of the property with the exception of the bona fide purchaser for value of a legal estate without notice of the equity. Bona fide means that the purchaser must act in good faith. Where, for example, he has colluded with the legal owner in an attempt to defeat the equity he will not be protected. The requirement that he is a purchaser means that he must take the property by some act or acts of the parties. A purchaser will include a mortgagee or a lessee.

For example, a person who acquires land through adverse possession by operation of the Statute of Limitations or a person who acquires land through the rules on intestacy by operation of the Succession Act would not be deemed to be a purchaser. The purchaser must be acquiring a legal estate in the property in order to be afforded protection. Where he is purchasing an equitable estate only then the rule is that the first in time will prevail. However, where the purchaser takes an equitable interest for value without notice he will defeat a mere equity (Allied Irish Bank Glynn [1973] 188). The requirement ''for value'' means that the purchaser must have given consideration in money or money''s worth or be within the marriage consideration in order to be protected. A person who receives a gift (a volunteer) will be bound by any prior equitable interests in the gift property. The necessity to be without notice means that the purchaser did not have actual, imputed or constructive notice of the equitable interest. A person who purchases from a bona fide purchaser for value of the legal estate also takes free of any equitable interest, even if they have notice of the equitable interest, provided that they are acting in good faith. A purchaser with notice from a purchaser without notice is protected if the transaction is bona fide, the only exception being the case of a trustee buying back trust property which he sold; or that of a fraudulent person, who has acquired the property by fraud saying that he has sold it to a bona fide person without notice and got it back again Stewart''s Estate (1893) 31 405).'),

Example: Where A and hold as joint tenants and A leaves all his property to then if A dies first will receive nothing. However, if dies first then A becomes the sole owner by right of survivorship and on his death the entire interest in the property will pass to under the will. The right of survivorship is useful where land is being held by trustees since when one trustee dies the property continues to be held by the surviving trustees without the necessity of a deed to vest the property in them again. (The survivors are usually given a power to appoint a replacement trustee). It is possible for a joint tenant to alienate their interest by selling it to another person. However, if this happens the joint tenancy is severed, and the result is a tenancy-in-common between the new purchaser and all of the other joint tenants.'),

There are a number of circumstances in which equity will intervene and deem that legal joint tenants or a sole owner holds the legal title on trust for two or more persons as tenants in common. Example: A and may hold the legal title as joint tenants. However, if equity deems there to be a tenancy in common then they hold the legal title on trust for themselves as tenants in common in equity. If A dies, then becomes the sole legal owner by right of survivorship. However, equity will deem that in that situation holds the sole legal ownership in trust for himself and the persons entitled to A''s estate as tenants in common. Therefore, if the property were to be sold the proceeds of sale would have to be divided as between and the persons entitled to A''s estate. (a) Joint Tenants who make Equal Contribution Where the property is held by two or more persons as joint tenants and the purchase money has been provided by them in equal amounts then equity will presume that there is nothing to displace the common law position and will deem that they hold as joint tenants in equity as in common law. However, this presumption can be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention. In O''Connell Harrison [1927] 330 a number of shares were purchased and put in the names of two sisters and as joint tenants. became of unsound mind and was appointed to act as her committee at law. died and was survived by who died two years later. The personal representatives of claimed that since the shares were held jointly the right of survivorship applied and E''s estate was entitled to the entire interest in the shares. There was no evidence that the shares had been purchased other than by equal contributions and the judge assumed that this was the case. However, the court determined that the shares were held as tenants in common in equity because: (1) The sisters had inherited a business and other shares from their father and had executed a deed declaring that these were held as tenants in common (2) They had bought other shares as joint tenants but had executed deeds declaring these to be held as tenants in common (3) While was acting as the committee of she had declared that was entitled to half the shares and had asked that they be applied to her maintenance. Joint Tenants who make Unequal Contribution Where the legal title is held jointly by two or more persons, but they have contributed to the purchase money in unequal shares then equity will presume that they hold the property on trust for themselves as tenants in common in equity in shares proportionate to their contributions. Example: A and hold a property as joint tenants but A paid 2/3 of the purchase money. Equity presumes that A did not intend to make a gift of the disproportionate amount of the purchase money to A and are deemed to hold the legal title in trust for themselves as tenants in common, A to hold two undivided one third shares and to hold one undivided one third share. Sole Owner Where one person holds the legal title, but more than one person has contributed towards the purchase money then equity will presume that the sole legal owner holds the property on trust for himself and the other persons as tenants in common in proportion to the contributions. Equity presumes that the party who contributed towards the purchase price did not intend to make a gift but intended to acquire some interest in the property arising out of his contributions. In Jones Jones [1977] 2 All 231 a father bought a house for his son. His son moved in with his wife and children and paid the father one quarter of the purchase price. The father died and the property vested in the plaintiff who was the son''s stepmother. She brought proceedings to evict the son, but the Court of Appeal held that as he was a tenant-in-common in equity on foot of his contribution he could not be evicted. Mortgage Loans Where two or more persons lend money on the mortgage of a property in their joint names then equity will presume that they hold the mortgage as tenants in common in equity. It does not matter whether they made equal or unequal contributions to the amount of the loan. Equity presumes that in such a commercial transaction the right of survivorship was not intended to apply. Partnerships Similarly, where two or more persons hold property jointly arising out of a commercial partnership arrangement, then equity will presume that they hold it as tenants in common. This presumption can be rebutted in certain circumstances. In Reilly Walsh (1849) 11 22 two brothers entered into a business partnership. One of them became mentally ill and was hospitalised and neglected to take any further part in the business. On his discharge he purported to leave his share in the business to his beneficiaries under a will. The court held that since the brother had not really been involved in the business the assets of the business were held jointly in equity and the gift under the will could be defeated by the right of survivorship.'),

The Defendant, in the course of his employment in the auctioneering business, learned of Mrs. Dolan''s death and of the apparent absence of any next of kin. He, it seems, broke into her home through the back door, in February, 1982, and has remained in possession of the premises, along with a Mary Grogan, since that date. The Plaintiff, as Chief State Solicitor and as personal representative, sought possession of the premises having extracted a grant of Letters of Administration in 2000. The Supreme Court interpreted the definition of ''State authority'' in section 2(1) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 as not including the Chief State Solicitor, notwithstanding that section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 puts him under the administration and control of the Attorney General (who is named expressly in the definition in section 2(1) of the 1957 Statute) and the longstanding practice of the Chief State Solicitor being the person to bring or defend proceedings on behalf of the State in respect of intestacies. The result was that the limitation period applied to the claim against the State as ultimate intestate successor in this case was the usual 12 years under section 13(2)(a) of the 1957 Statute, and not the 30 years applicable to a State authority under section13(1)(a). See Keating, The Recovery of Estates of Deceased Persons by a State Authority, Conveyancing & Property Law Journal (2013) 18 (3), 54-57. The limitation period is shorter (six years) where the interest forms part of the estate of a deceased person and a beneficiary has been dispossessed. This six-year period is extended under section 127 of the 1965 Act by a further period of 3 years in the case of shares of persons who are under disability.

It seems clear from the case law that there are two elements that need to be considered, a factual element and a mental element. The mental element is usually referred to as the animus possidendi, or the intention to possess and it involves the intention to exclude the true owner. The person must both subjectively intend to possess the lands in his own right, but he must also be able to point to acts on his part that manifest such an intention objectively. Of course, these acts will be the same acts that are relied on to prove the factual element of his possession as well. Use of the land without the requisite intention to possess is not adverse possession. The requirement for a manifested intention to possess the lands and assert exclusive control over the lands explains why the Courts have traditionally attached so much importance to the question of boundaries when considering whether there has been actual possession of the lands. Where there is strong evidence showing that the squatter has physically separated the lands from the remainder of the lands held by the true owner, the Court may allow a claim based on relatively slight acts of user. The physical incorporation of the lands with other lands owned by the squatter and the separation of the lands from those of the true owner displays prima facie an intention to possess. The control exercised by the squatter over the lands must be effective control. It must also be single and exclusive. In Powell MacFarlane (1977) 38 & 452 the Court held that ploughing and cultivating agricultural land was an act so drastic that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it showed an intention to possess and appropriate the land in question. In Scanlon Larkin [2011] IEHC 549, O''Keeffe ruled that a claim to title by adverse possession of part of commonage land failed because the claimants had failed to prove either the necessary intention to possess or exclusive physical control of the land at issue. The judge was not convinced that there had been much quarrying activity over the period claimed (other than taking the odd stones) or that there had been sufficient fencing to keep out animals or to withstand the elements in the very exposed area of land in question. Exclusivity is what distinguishes possession of the lands from mere occupation. Sometimes the distinction between them can be difficult to establish. Lord Denning suggested that the person in actual possession has effective control over the land. He is in charge of it. Nobody can use the land except with his permission or pursuant to a specific limited right, such as an easement. In Wilson Martin''s Executors [1993] 1 EGLR 178 the claimant had cut trees from the lands in question, cleared fallen timber and repaired the boundary fences. The Court of Appeal however, determined that repairing an existing fence was not sufficient to show an intention to the world at large to exclude the true owner; cutting trees to repair the fences was of no significance as the squatter had agreed to use the cut trees to repair the fences and taking timber for firewood was not probative in circumstances where the squatter believed at the time that the true owner would not object. In Convey Regan [1952] 56 Black held that a long period of cutting turf from a bog will not be evidence of possession of the lands. However, he said that a claimant could take possession of a bog by excluding others, for example by fencing off the bog, or putting up notices asserting his claim or proving that he had personally warned others off the lands. These acts would go beyond a mere right of turbary. The possession must be open and obvious to the extent that a true owner investigating the situation, or any other person, would know that the squatter was in possession of the lands in question. However, this does not mean that a squatter cannot acquire title against a true owner who is ignorant of his own title to the lands in question, once it is obvious that the squatter is in possession. The Irish case of Murphy Murphy [1980] 183 is authority for this proposition. In that case, Kenny found that a son was in adverse possession of lands over which his mother was the true owner, in circumstances where neither the son nor the mother was aware that the mother had been granted title to the lands under the will of her late husband. Where a person is in occupation of lands as an agent or employee, then he will be deemed to be in possession on behalf of his principal or his employer. Similarly, a squatter may be said to be in possession of lands even in a situation where he has let the lands to a tenant. This emphasises the difference between occupation and possession: The tenant is in occupation of the lands, but the squatter is said to continue in possession provided that he maintains sole and exclusive control over the lands, even in the capacity of a landlord. Most cases involving adverse possession are determined by reference to the factual circumstances in which the claimant was in possession of the lands in question. In the case of Doyle O''Neill (unreported, Appeal from 13 January 1995) O''Hanlon explained the following: In order to defeat the title of the original landowner, of opinion that the adverse user must be of a definite and positive character and such as could leave no doubt in the mind of a landowner alert to his rights that occupation adverse to his title was taking place. This is particularly the case when the parcel of land involved is for the time being worthless or valueless for the purposes of the original owner'),

This reasoning was followed in Ireland in the case of Cork Corporation Lynch (1995) 2 ILRM 598. However, in Durack Manufacturing Considine [1987] 677 Barron declined to follow this line of reasoning and he stated that the Statute quite clearly contains no reference to the intention of the true owner and the Court is not required to consider the intention of the true owner in determining whether there has been adverse possession. He stated that "There seems to be no reason in principle why the relevant provisions of the Statute of Limitations should be adapted to allow for the case of an owner who stands by and allows another to use his land merely because he wishes to use it for a specific purpose in the future". His view was that the only time it became relevant was in considering whether the squatter was aware of the intention of the true owner, in which case it might detract from the necessary animus possidendi. He stated that: Adverse possession depends on the existence of animus possidendi and it is the presence or absence of this state of mind which must be determined. Where no use is being made of the land and the claimant knows that the owner intends to use it for a specific purpose in the future, this is a factor to be taken into account. The principle has relevance only insofar as that when the factor is present it is easier to hold an absence of animus possidendi. In the recent decision of Pye (Oxford) Limited Graham the House of Lords also came to the conclusion that the intention of the true owner is not relevant in an inquiry into adverse possession.'),

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the owner of land with the paper title is deemed to be in possession of the land, as being the person with the prima facie right to possession. The law will thus, without reluctance, ascribe possession either to the paper owner or to persons who can establish a title of claiming through the paper owner. If the law is to attribute possession of land to a person who can establish no paper title to possession, he must be shown to have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess ("animus possidendi"). 2. Factual possession signifies an appropriate degree of physical control. It must be a single and conclusive possession, though there can be a single possession exercised by or on behalf of several persons jointly. Thus, an owner of land and a person intruding on that land cannot both be in possession of the land at the same time. The question of what acts constitute a sufficient degree of exclusive physical control must depend on the circumstances, in particular the nature of the land and the manner in which land of that nature is commonly used or enjoyed. In Údarás Eitlíochta hÉireann & anor Monks & anor [2017] IEHC 440 McGovern ruled that by virtue of various agreements relating to land adjoining Dublin airport entered into by a father, and later by his son, the latter did not have the necessary intention to possess to sustain a claim to ownership by adverse possession. Nor had he shown the necessary factual possession or control as he had engaged in only intermittent and minimal activities in a concealed matter - none of these were sufficient to displace the ownership acquired by the airport authorities by virtue of the previous agreements. The final resolution of the ongoing applicability (if any) of the rule in Leigh Jack probably requires a comprehensive decision from one of the superior courts in respect of an appropriate case where ratio specifically turns on the issue. The judgment of Charleton in the recent Supreme Court decision of Ulster Investment Bank Limited Rockrohan Estate Limited [2015] IESC 17 is, arguably, also obiter (at [12]): Not all possession of land or premises, otherwise than by its owner, is adverse. In some cases it has been held that the intention of the owner as to the future use of the land may result in what would otherwise be the ordinary and complete use and possession of land by a stranger to the title not being adverse; Leigh Jack (1879) 5 264, Wallis''s Cayton Bay Holiday Camp Ltd Shell-Mex and Ltd [1975] 1 94, Cork Corporation Lynch [1995] 2 ILRM 598. This line of authority was criticised by Brady and Kerr as being "arguably subversive of the policy reasons which have undergirded successive statutes of limitations"; Brady and Kerr - Limitation of Actions edition, Dublin, 1994) at page 101. It was not followed by Barron in Seamus Durack Manufacturing Limited Considine [1987] 677. Such a principle, those commentators point out, would also make apparently overt acts of dispossession as may found adverse possession depend upon the subjective intention of the owner of the title to land. Some parcels of land, however, may be such as to constitute waste land, or land which is not capable of use or enjoyment, save perhaps on rare occasions. An example of this would be land beside or under a bridge that the owner used only for periods of inspection of the structure; Dundalk UDC Conway [1987] IEHC 3. Founding the concept of adverse possession is the principle that the party thereby claiming rights must not take or hold the land by force, by deception or with the permission of the owner of the legal title; or as lawyers of an earlier generation would have expressed it nec nec clam, nec precario. Charleton also alluded to the rule in Leigh Jack in similar terms in the Supreme Court decision in Dunne Iarnrod Eireann & Anor. [2016] IESC 47: While in some cases the title holder''s intention for future use has defeated what might ordinarily seem a complete form of occupation by the party claiming adverse possession, this is not determinative and may be no more than a factor; see Leigh Jack (1879) 5 264, Wallis''s Cayton Bay Holiday Camp Ltd Shell-Mex and Ltd [1975] 1 94, Cork Corporation Lynch [1995] ILRM 598, and to the contrary Seamus Durack Manufacturing Limited Considine [1987] 677. The matter does not now arise for decision. While Clarke preferred the latter case, counsel for CIÉ conceded that for much of the decade''s past, CIÉ had no particular plan for this field. Hence, no ruling is made as to future intended use on this appeal. Clarke correctly identified that mere occupation is not enough to ground a claim of adverse possession and that what is also required is that the ostensible adverse occupier of the land does so with the intention of excluding the original owner. The matter is put thus in Halsbury''s Laws of England, volume'),

As such, while a determinative decision in this jurisdiction from the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court would be helpful in terms of conclusively resolving this troublesome aspect of the law in relation to adverse possession, it certainly appears that there is a strongly expressed judicial preference from the superior courts towards viewing the issue of future intended use of land as merely representing a factor in the analysis as to whether the owner of land has been fully dispossessed in the eyes of the law.'),

The Act was designed to protect the family home by protecting the rights of a non-owning spouse to reside in the family home. The main provision of the Act is that the spouse who holds the legal and equitable interest in the family home cannot convey or transfer that interest to a third party without the prior written consent of the nonowning spouse. Section 3(1) of the 1976 Act provides as follows: "Where a spouse, without prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to sections (2), (3) and (8) and section 4, the purported conveyance shall be void". Accordingly, the essential requirement of the 1976 Act is that prior written consent is obtained from the non-owing spouse whenever there is a conveyance of a family home. Where prior written consent is not obtained the consequences are drastic as the conveyance is deemed to be void with the result that no interest passes to the purchaser.

The nonowning spouse merely has a right of veto, that is, he or she can refuse to consent to a conveyance of the property. The Act does not confer any property rights on the non-owning spouse, and it does not give him or her any legal or equitable interest in the family home (Guckian Brennan [1981] 478). Where the prior written consent has not been obtained, the conveyance is not void initio but merely voidable at the instance of the non-owning spouse. It has been held that only the spouse affected can exercise his or her right to void the conveyance. In Barclays Bank (Ireland) Ltd. Carroll (unreported 10 September 1986) the husband transferred the family home to without the prior written consent of the spouse. mortgaged the property to the and then went bankrupt. The Official Assignee in Bankruptcy sought to avoid the mortgage on the basis that the provisions of the 1976 Act had not been complied with, but Hamilton held that the provisions of the Act were exercisable only by the nonowning spouse and the bank could not exercise the rights conferred by the Act. Section 4 of the 1976 Act makes provision for a Court in certain circumstances to dispense with the consent of a non-owning spouse, where the non-owing spouse omits or refuses to give the required consent under section 3(1). The Court will not dispense with the consent of a spouse unless the court considers that it is unreasonable for the spouse to withhold consent, taking into account all the circumstances including the respective needs and recourses of the spouses and of any dependent children, and where offered the suitability of alternative accommodation. Accordingly, where the non-owning spouse unreasonably withholds his or her consent, then section 4 of the Act permits either the vendor or purchaser to apply to court for an order dispensing with the need of the non-owning spouse''s consent. Section 31 of the 2009 Act preserves the existing jurisdiction of the court in relation to section 4 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. Section 5 (1) of the 1976 Act allows a non-owning spouse to apply to Court for relief where the other spouse is engaging in such conduct as may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home or render it uninhabitable for use as a family home with the intention of depriving the applicant or their dependent children of the family home. Section 12 of the Act applies where the family home is a registered property and it allows the non-owning spouse to apply to the Land Registry for the entry of a note on the Register of his or her marriage to a person having an interest in the property. This clearly puts prospective purchasers on notice of the need to obtain the prior written consent of the applicant spouse. Under section 54 of the Family Law Act,1995 the non-owning spouse can give a general consent in writing to any future conveyance of any interest in a dwelling that is or was the family home of that spouse and where the deed for any such conveyance is executed after the date of that consent, the consent shall be deemed to be a prior consent in writing of the spouse to that conveyance. This is a useful provision in the case of a separation as it will relieve the owner of having to seek the consent of his or her spouse to a future disposition of the property.'),

Accordingly, whenever you are dealing with any one or more of the documents referred to above in relation to a family home prior written consent of the nonowning spouse should be obtained. The courts have held that where the non-owning spouse consents only to the contract for sale but not to the conveyance that the consent to the contract will be taken as consent to the subsequent conveyance of the property (Kyne Tiernan (unreported, 15 July 1980). It is nonetheless good practice to have the consent of the non-owning spouse endorsed on both the contract for sale and the subsequent conveyance. It appears from case law that further advances of monies on foot of an equitable mortgage will be deemed to be a conveyance within the meaning of the Act. In Bank of Ireland Purcell [1990] ILRM 106 the bank held an equitable mortgage over the property on foot of a deposit of title deeds prior to the operation of the Act. Subsequent to the 1976 Act the bank purported to make further advances on foot of this security. The court held that this constituted a further disposition of the interest of the mortgagor and that in the circumstances the prior consent of the non-owning spouse should have been obtained. A judgment mortgage is not a conveyance within the meaning of the 1976 Act and is regarded as a process of execution. There is nothing therefore preventing a judgment mortgage being registered against a family home without requiring the consent of a non-owning spouse (see Murray Diamond [1982] ILRM 113 and Containercare Wycherley [1982] 143). It is clear from the wording of section 1 of the 1976 Act that there is no requirement on a spouse to obtain the consent of his or her non-owning spouse before making a devise of the family home under a will. Whilst the 1976 Act fails to protect the non-owning spouse in this instance, on death of the owning spouse, the surviving spouse is protected by various provisions under the Succession Act, 1965.'),

The expression comprises, in addition, a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue ordinarily resides or, if that spouse has left the other spouse, ordinarily resided before so leaving". Accordingly, where a spouse whose rights are vulnerable has been forced to leave the property formerly occupied with his or her spouse, the property remains a family home for the purposes of the Act. The definition also includes a dwelling in which a spouse is residing, having been forced by the other spouse to leave the former family home. The rule of thumb to follow is ''once a family home, always a family home''. A property will only be a family home where the spouses are in actual residence in the property; however, it is not necessary that the parties be in an intimate relationship (see [1980] ILRM 257). In terms of where a married couple ordinarily reside, it is clear that a property in which they intend to reside is not protected by the Act (see National Irish Bank Graham [1995] 2 However, in practice the consent of the nonowning spouse should be sought and obtained whenever there is a doubt that the property may be a family home within the meaning of the 1976 Act. A ''dwelling'' is defined as any building or part of a building occupied as a separate dwelling and includes any garden or other land usually occupied with the dwelling, being land that is subsidiary and ancillary to it, is required for amenity or convenience and is not being used or developed primarily for commercial purposes, and includes a structure that is not permanently attached to the ground and a vehicle, or vessel, whether mobile or not, occupied as a separate dwelling (as amended by section 54(1) (a) of the Family Law Act, 1995). Where the family home is attached to other commercial property, for example in the case of a farm or a pub, it is possible to sell the other property without requiring the prior written consent of the non-owing spouse. In Havbell DAC Dias [2018] IEHC 175, the High Court clarified, once more, how the commercial use of a premises can exclude it from the definition of a "family home" as provided for in the section 2 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. In this case, the premises in question was also being used for short term commercial letting, and this function (which operated in tandem with the Defendant''s residential occupation of the premises) removed the premises from the scope of the 1976 Act. Costello said (at [51]- [52]): In addition, it is important to note that the tenancy agreement upon which she says she is entitled to occupy the property is a business letting agreement not a residential letting. The fact that she and her family reside in the premises does not make this a family home within the meaning of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. The definition of a family home means any building or part of a building occupied as a separate dwelling ... ''and is not being used or developed primarily for commercial purposes...'' In light of the fact that from 2015 to 2017 the premises operated as an AirBnB and her counsel accepts that there is a commercial aspect to the letting, it seems to me that the premises cannot be described as a family home within the meaning of the Act. Certainly, she has for a number of years profited from the use of the building as a guesthouse or hostel through the AirBnB website. This conclusion does not mean that the property has not been her residence as well as her place of business. It is the home where she lives with her husband who suffers from ill health..."'),

In accordance with the 1976 Act the consent of the non-owning spouse must be in writing and must be given prior to the execution of the conveyance. It is usual to have the non-owning spouse endorse the contract before any other party executes it as it is clear from case law that the conveyance cannot be ratified subsequently by the endorsement of the non-owning spouse. Auctions can present particular problems in this regard. Ideally the vendor should arrange to have the non-owning spouse present at the auction to endorse his or her consent on the contract, once the auction has concluded successfully. If this is not possible, the non-owning spouse should execute a separate consent prior to the auction. This should set out that the spouse consents to the sale of the property at auction and should stipulate a minimum sale price (usually the reserve). If the property does not achieve this price at the auction, the consent of the spouse will not be valid. As conveyancers came to terms with the need for consents, queries were raised about a number of different situations. It was, for example, held by the Supreme Court in Nestor Murphy [1979] 326 (where the vendors were the joint owners of the family home trying to resist an order for specific performance of the contract of sale) that the purpose of the 1976 Act precluded an interpretation of section 3(1) which would have the result of applying the provisions of that sub-section to a conveyance or a contract of sale, which had been executed by both spouses by mutual consent. At attempt to distinguish Nestor Murphy in circumstances where only one spouse derived a benefit from the transaction giving rise to the security was rejected by Hedigan in the High Court decision of Irish Nationwide Building Society Rafferty [2012] IEHC 352. In Jeffel (In Receivership) [2012] IEHC 279, Gilligan concluded that the reference in the definition of ''family home'' at section 2 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 Act to ''the spouse whose protection is in issue'' must be presumed to be a reference to the ''non-owning spouse'' as it would be absurd to find that a spouse vested with full legal and equitable title in a property could have recourse to the 1976 Act. Similarly, in the High Court decision of Allies Irish Banks plc Darcy [2015] IEHC 353, Keane followed the foregoing line of authority and held that the Second Named Defendant was incorrect in her assertions that, as a joint protagonists in the transactions which she later sought to impugn, she could rely on the protections afforded by the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 (in respect of a property which, the court noted, had, in fact, been "destroyed in an accidental fire some time ago and has not yet been reinstated"). Keane held that: Applying the foregoing analysis to the circumstances of the present case, it seems to me that the second named defendant is confusing the situation that appertained here, i.e. one in which she jointly engaged in transactions concerning the family home that she and her husband jointly owned, with the quite different one whereby a spouse, as sole owner of the family home, purports to deal with that property without the consent of the other non-owning spouse. Accordingly, satisfied that there is nothing in the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act1976 as applied to the circumstances of the present case which operates to prevent the bank from obtaining the Order that it now seeks for possession of the properties. On the other hand, the initial view that the 1976 Act did not apply where the vendor was a company was undermined by the case of Walpoles Ltd Jay (Unreported, High Court, 20 November 1981) with the result that it is necessary to look at each transaction to see if a family home is in fact involved such that a consent is necessary. The consent of the non-owning spouse must be informed consent. This means that the spouse must know what he or she is consenting to and what the consequences of the proposed conveyance or mortgage are (see Allied Irish Banks Finnegan [1996] 1 ILRM 401). There is an onus on a third party (purchaser or mortgagor) to ensure that the consent is a real consent once they are on notice that they are dealing with a family home (see Bank of Ireland Smyth [1993] 2 109). In practice it is advisable to ensure that the non-owning spouse has been advised of the consequences of providing their consent and that independent legal advice in relation to the issue of their consent has been obtained. A consent that has been obtained without the benefit of legal advice will be vulnerable to being set aside at a later date. It will be difficult to stand over consent where the same solicitor acts for both the owner and the non-owning spouse as a clear a conflict of interest arises.'),

It provides that where the conveyance is to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice that the consent is required or has not been given that the conveyance will be valid, however, where the purchaser for value is on notice that the consent of the spouse was required and has not been given, the conveyance will be void. Where the vendor does not disclose that he is conveying a family home the test in Reynolds Waters [1982] ILRM 335 will apply. In this case the Supreme Court stated that there is no principle that the prudent purchaser should not accept the uncorroborated statutory declaration of the vendor merely because the vendor has a financial interest in the transaction. If the statement later turns out to be inaccurate then the bona fide purchaser is protected by section 3 of the Act. However, if there were reasons why the purchaser''s solicitor should have doubted the veracity of the vendor''s statement then the situation might be different. A good example arose in the case of Somers Weir [1979] 94 in which the vendor made a statutory declaration that he was separated, that his wife had deserted him, and that the property was no longer a family home. He also stated that by virtue of a separation agreement his wife no longer had any legal or equitable interest in the property. In fact, the agreement made no mention of the property. The plaintiff purchased the house and then tried to obtain a mortgage. The bank required the consent of the wife and the plaintiff had to locate her, but she then refused to give her consent. The plaintiff brought an application under section 4 of the Act to dispense with the consent of the wife. The Supreme Court held that it could not dispense with consent where the conveyance had already been executed in order to mend the situation retrospectively. The Court also held that the plaintiff was fixed with constructive notice of the wife''s interest in the property and her statutory right to refuse her consent to the conveyance. In this case the plaintiff''s solicitor knew of the existence of the separation agreement but neglected to look for a copy of it. It appears therefore that if the purchaser knows that the vendor is married but separated, he is put on notice that the non-owning spouse may have an interest in the property.'),

However, section of the Family Law Act, 1995 introduced a six-year limitation period in respect of proceedings initiated under the Family Home Protection Act by a non-owning spouse seeking to declare a conveyance void. This is subject to the exception that a spouse who is in occupation of the family home from immediately before the expiry of the limitation period from the date of the conveyance in question up to the institution of proceedings will not be barred by the six-year rule. Example: executes a mortgage of the family home on 30 Jan 1990 without the prior written consent of Under the six-year rule she has until 29 Jan 1996 to commence proceedings to set aside the mortgage. However, if has been in actual occupation of the family home from a date prior to 30 Jan 1990, and unhappy differences arise between and after the 6-year period has elapsed, can still commence proceedings under the Family Home Protection Act to have the mortgage declared void. In practice, the vendor will usually furnish a Statutory Declaration setting out the position with regard to the family home. The Declaration will state either that the property is not a family home by reason of the fact that the vendor is not married or that no married couple resides in the property. Otherwise, the vendor will exhibit a copy of his marriage certificate confirming his marriage and the prior written consent of the spouse will be furnished. The Law Society Conveyancing Committee has recommended that it is best practice to use such Statutory Declarations to establish the position with regard to the family home. An alternative that is sometimes seen is a certificate by a solicitor stating that the property is not a family home. This is acceptable although not regarded as being the best evidence in this situation. Where a nonowning spouse seeks to challenge a conveyance on the basis of a failure to comply with the provisions of the 1976 Act, he or she is required to lodge a statement declaring the conveyance to be void in either the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds (as the case may be) and to register a lis pendens against the property. Therefore, to guard against this possibility the purchaser''s solicitor should conduct the appropriate searches in these registers to establish that the conveyance under which they are purchasing the property is not the subject of any such challenge.

The wife had used her salary to pay for a car, which was used by both spouses, and to buy items for the house. Keane held that any such contributions would only give rise to an equitable interest where there is evidence before the court of a common intention to this effect. In the absence of any such agreement he dismissed the claim. However, in [1981] ILRM 202 Finlay commented on the value of indirect contributions that where a wife contributes to a general family fund thus releasing her husband from an obligation to discharge liabilities from that fund and permitting him to repay mortgage instalments, she will in the absence of proof of an inconsistent agreement or arrangement be entitled to an equitable share in the property. The Supreme Court approved this reasoning in McC. McC. [1984] IESC 1. In that case the wife had contributed towards the purchase of the previous family home and when it was sold the proceeds were put towards the cost of furniture in the new home. The new home was purchased by the husband''s employers and secured by a mortgage. The Court held that the wife had not contributed either directly or indirectly towards the purchase of the second house. However, the Court affirmed that where a wife makes indirect contributions such as applying her earnings to a general family fund, the court will in the absence of an agreement to the contrary infer a trust in favour of the wife on the grounds that she has relieved the husband of the financial burden he incurred in purchasing the house.'),

Barron held that a constructive trust should be imposed to the effect that the aunt''s estate was entitled to a three-quarter share in the beneficial interest.

The testator left a cottage in Crumlin to a married daughter subject to a right of residence in favour of another daughter, the plaintiff. The married daughter was registered as owner and the right of residence registered as a burden on the folio. The owner died having left the cottage to her son. He carried out improvements on the cottage and then sought to extinguish the right of residence. The plaintiff left the house to live elsewhere but later sought an injunction to restrain the defendant interfering with the right. Lavan said that the right had not been abandoned in a situation where the plaintiff had been forced out. He said that the right is not abandoned by an absence of any length. The right cannot be varied by the owner. The right may be abandoned voluntarily if it is done expressly and freely or by effluxion of time. However, a court would require strong evidence from a party seeking to defeat such a right while the right remains a burden on the folio and in the absence of an express agreement that discloses an intention to abandon. In relation to the value of the right of residence he held that because the right of residence is an ongoing one its financial equivalent should be determined on a periodic basis. The value of a right of residence should not be estimated on a capitalised basis since this would be to treat the right in the same manner as a life estate. The court should be able to embark upon such a valuation either under its equitable jurisdiction or at the behest of the parties. The court should look at the rental value of equivalent property elsewhere or the cost one would reasonably expect a relative to contribute in respect of the right to reside. The valuation of a right of residence is not compensatory. The defendant''s absence of means should be taken into account. The infringement of a right of residence is an act that warrants substantial damages in most cases. More recently in the case of Bracken Byrne [2005] IEHC 180 Clarke considered a case where the plaintiff enjoyed a right of residence, maintenance and support. He held that the primary entitlement of a beneficiary of a right was to have that right enforced and therefore the beneficiary should be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief to ensure that they could enjoy that right. He found that there could be circumstances, however, where that would not be practical or reasonable and, in such circumstances, the appropriate form of redress would be to value the rights and direct that the beneficiary be paid for those rights rather than to grant injunctive relief. Clarke also held that, in addition to proving that it had become unreasonable to require the beneficiary to be content with the exercise of the rights due to a breakdown in a quasi-family relationship between the beneficiary and the owner, it was also necessary that the balance of responsibility for that situation lay with the owner in order that those rights be converted to money. The ability of the defendant to pay the sums thus awarded would also be an important factor in the exercise of the court''s discretion as to whether the remedy should be by way of injunctive relief or the payment of the sum of money in lieu thereof.'),

The important attribute of easements and profits prendre is that both the benefit and the burden of easements will pass with the lands and will bind the successors in title of the parties who created them. A profit prendre is the right to go onto someone else''s land and to take from it something which belongs on it naturally, such as the right to mine or quarry, cut timber or turf, graze animals on grass, fish and hunt wild game.

The lands must be neighbouring but not necessarily contiguous. In Pugh Savage [1970] 2 373 a right of way existed even though both tenements were separated by an intervening plot of land. In Latimer Official Cooperative Society (1885) 16 305 where there were three terraced houses in a row it was held that a right of support existed between the first and third house. It is an important principle that an easement cannot be held in gross. This means that a person who does not hold an estate in land cannot be entitled to exercise an easement. 1.1.2 The right must accommodate the dominant tenement and be a burden to the servient tenement An easement must not merely benefit the owner of the dominant land, but it must actually improve the dominant land in some respect, whether in terms of convenience, utility or amenity. It can be difficult to determine whether or not a right benefits the land. In Hill Tupper (1863) 2 H&C 121 the owner of a boat yard had been granted a lease of land adjoining the canal together with "the exclusive right or liberty" to use and hire out pleasure boats. This was not deemed to be an easement as the benefit accrued to the business and not directly to the land. However, in Moody Steggles (1879) 12 Ch.D 261 it was held that the right of the owner of a public house to place a sign on a neighbouring premises was capable of being an easement. An easement cannot exist where it interferes with the servient tenement to the extent that the owner cannot enjoy exclusive occupation of his property. Therefore, a general right to park cars in an area can be an easement but a right to park in a particular place cannot (London and Blenheim Estates Ltd Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd [1993] 4 All 157). 1.1.3 The dominant and servient tenements must not be owned and occupied by the same person The dominant and servient tenements must be held under separate ownership. Clearly a person cannot enjoy an easement over his own land since he could not enforce such a right against himself. However, it is not a bar to the recognition of an easement that the freehold interest in the tenements are owned by the same person as long as they are occupied by different persons. Therefore, a tenant may acquire an easement against a tenement owned and occupied by his landlord. (Hanna Pollock [1900] 2 664). 1.1.4 The right must be capable of being the subject matter of a grant. There are two aspects to this requirement. In the first place it means that the right should be sufficiently clear and precise to enable it to be enforced. Secondly, the courts will tend to enforce only those rights that have traditionally been recognised as easements in the past. (a) Clarity and Precision Where the extent of the right claimed is difficult or impossible to define it will not be enforceable and it is unlikely to be recognised as an easement. In Pwllbach Colliery Ltd Woodman [1915] 634 the owners of a coal mine were not able to enforce a right to allow coal dust to blow onto neighbouring lands as the servient tenement could not be clearly identified. In the case of Phipps Pears (1965) 1 76 it was stated that a right to a view cannot be granted in the form of an easement as it is too vague. In general, a court is unlikely to recognise a particular right as an easement if the exercise of the right involves expenditure by the servient owner, if it is purely restrictive or negative in nature or if the exercise of the right is contrary to public policy, for example, a right to release a pollutant onto lands. In Regis Property Ltd. Redman [1956] 2 612 the Court refused to recognise a right to a supply of hot water as an easement on the basis that such a right would require expenditure on the part of the servient owner. Historical Precedent It has been stated that incidents of a novel kind cannot be devised and attached to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner, per Brougham in Keppell Bailey (1834) 2 My & 517. However, the more pragmatic approach of Lord Leonard in Dyce Lady James Hay (1852) 1 Macq. held that the category of servitudes and easements must alter and expand with the changes that take place in the circumstances of mankind. Nevertheless, it will be difficult to enforce a right that has not previously been recognised as an easement. In Ellenborough Park [1956] 131 the right to walk in a park adjacent to property was recognised as the right was more than mere personal enjoyment and was held to enhance and accommodate the property.'),

Long and uninterrupted enjoyment of an easement or a profit as of right can give rise to an irrebuttable presumption of legality. The acquisition of an easement or profit in this manner is called prescription. Traditionally, three methods of prescription were recognised: Prescription at Common Law, prescription under the Doctrine of Lost Modern Grant and by way of the Prescription (Ireland) Act, 1858. The 2009 Act was introduced to clarify the law but ultimately failed to do so and has been described as "a spectacular failure of legislative form" by Bland; The Law of Easements and Profits Prendre, Dublin, Round Hall, Sweet & Maxwell, 2009. In order to acquire an easement by prescription it has been necessary that the user be: (1) open and notorious, that is, evident on inspection (2) adverse, that is, without the permission of the owner of the servient lands (3) continuous and uninterrupted, and (4) for the statutory period. It is an important principle that the user should have enjoyed the right as if he were fully entitled to it and without force, secrecy or permission (nec nec clam nec precario). A claim that an easement had been acquired by prescription in circumstances where a landowner permitted the drivers of oil tankers and "ride on" lawnmowers and other visitors to traverse his land for the purpose of gaining convenient access to a neighbouring property for a period of twenty years created a right of way in favour of that neighbouring property was rejected by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal in Zopitar Ltd. Jacob [2015] IEHC 790; [2017] IECA 183. In the Court of Appeal, Hogan summarised the general position under the Prescription Acts as follows: It is clear from the authorities that in order to establish such a prescriptive claim under the 1832 Act, the user must be ''as of right'' and that this requirement imports the traditional concepts of nec nec clam and nec precario : see, e.g. , Gardner Hodgson''s Kingston Brewery Ltd [1903] A.C. 229, 239 , per Lord Lindley and Oxfordshire C.C., Sunningwell Parish Council [2000] 1 A.C. 335, 353 per Lord Hoffmann... ... It is accordingly clear from these authorities that in order to establish such a prescriptive claim under the 1832 Act, the user must be ''as of right'' and that this accordingly imports the traditional concepts of nec nec clam and nec precario . There is, of course, no question of force (vis) or secrecy (clam) in the user in the present case. The real question is whether the user amounted to precario. The concept of nec nec clam , nec precario (''without force, without stealth and without permission'') is a quintessentially Roman law concept which, it is now generally accepted, was taken over by Bracton in his four books of Legibus Consuetudinibus Angliae (''On the laws and customs of England'') which were published sometime around 1235: see'),

By Release This occurs where the dominant owner agrees to release the servient lands from the burden of the easement. A release can be either express or implied. At common law an express release must be executed by way of deed. However, in equity, a person who releases his entitlement to an easement in a less formal manner, for example, in writing or by oral agreement supported by acts of part performance, may be estopped from later relying on the easement (Cook Mayor of Bath (1868) 6 177). (iii)By Non-User This will only result in the extinguishment of the easement where an intention to abandon can be proved, that is, where it can be shown that the person entitled to the easement has ceased to enjoy the easement with the intention of relinquishing the right permanently. The Courts have held that in order to abandon a right of way, there must be a fixed intention never again to assert the right (Tehidy Minerals Norman [1971] 2 Q.B. 528). Non-user of a right of way, while it can be evidence of an intention to release or abandon the easement, is never in itself sufficient evidence for that purpose (Carroll Sheridan [1984] I.L.R.M. 451). Because a right of way is a valuable property right, the courts will not lightly find that such a right has been released or abandoned (Orwell Park Management Ltd. Henihan [2004] IEHC 87 (Unreported, High Court, Herbert May 2004)). In Benn Hardinge (1992) 66 & C.R. 346, the Court of Appeal declined to find an intention on the part of the dominant owner to abandon a right of way even though no use had been made of that right of way for more than 175 years because the owner of the dominant tenement had other means of access to the land. In Peilow Ffrench O''Carroll (1972) 106 I.L.T.R. 30 at 49, Budd held that allowing a lane to become overgrown and lately to be blocked by a gate did not suffice to show an intention to abandon a right of way already acquired. Such an intention to abandon may be presumed after 20 years of non-use but the courts will be reluctant to allow this presumption without supporting evidence. The presumption will also arise where the easement has been replaced by an alternative right (Smith Wilson [1903] 2 45). Section 39 of the 2009 Act made provision for the extinguishment of easements or profits prendre however section 39 of the 2009 Act was repealed by section 6 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2021. In relation to the extinguishment of easements and profits prendre, Section 4 of the 2021 Act provides that: It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that section 39 (repealed by section 6 (1)) of the Act of 2009 was without prejudice to the application of the common law with regard to the extinguishment of an easement or profit prendre howsoever or whenever acquired and, accordingly, the common law shall apply to such extinguishment. By Ownership and Occupation of both Tenements Where the dominant and servient tenements come into common ownership, the easements will be extinguished as one of the essential requirements of an easement is thereby lost.'),

At common law where there was a mortgage, the mortgagee acquired a proprietary interest in the land by way security for the monies advanced. As a result, when a mortgagor failed to repay the loan, the mortgagee would retain the interest in the land and if the loan was repaid, the mortgagee would undertake to transfer the interest in the land to the mortgagor. The proprietary interest transferred to the mortgagee was done so subject to a right to redeem and an equity of redemption. A redemption date would be set for the payment of the mortgage and if it passed without the loan and interest having been repaid, the mortgagee could then retain whatever monies had been paid and the land mortgaged with the mortgagor remaining under an obligation to repay the debt owed. Equity intervened and sought to protect the interests of the mortgagor. Equity regarded it as inconsistent with the concept of security that a borrower may end up losing their real property as a result of late repayment. Equity established transactions so that the mortgagee acquired the real property as security only and permitted the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage by repayment of the loan and interest even after the date fixed for redemption had passed. The date of redemption would be specified in the mortgage agreement. The equity of redemption refers to the right of a mortgagor to redeem his property once the liability secured by the mortgage has been discharged. Accordingly, the equity of redemption represents the mortgagor''s ownership or interest in the property. The intervention of equity led to a situation whereby the mortgage operated only as a means of securing the charge, therefore the owner of the property at all times remained the mortgagor and the mortgagee merely had the benefit of a charge on the property until such time as the loan repayments was discharged in full.'),

Since domestic rates were abolished by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 and section 115 of the Valuation Act , 2001 declared that domestic premises ''shall not be rateable'', the Circuit Court lost jurisdiction in respect of such premises because under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 that jurisdiction was specifically linked to rateable value in land transactions. Hogan pointed out that section 45 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, 2004 made provision for switching the jurisdictional limit from rateable value to market value but for no apparent reason that section had never been commenced. In January 2017, section 45 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, 2004 was commenced in order to deal with the implications of the decision.

Thereafter he has an equitable right to redeem the property. If the mortgagee has not requested repayment, the mortgagor must give reasonable notice of his intention to redeem (usually six months) and he must pay the principal and all arrears of interest. Once the principal sum and the interest are repaid, the mortgagor is entitled to get the property back as free as when he mortgaged it.

Clauses which attempt to fetter or restrict the right of the mortgagor to redeem the property will be invalid. However, clauses which postpone the right to redeem will be permitted. A collateral advantage is a provision in a mortgage deed that entitles the mortgagee to something more than just repayment of the loan and interest. A collateral advantage will be enforceable unless it is oppressive or unconscionable or unless it is calculated to prevent or unduly hamper the redemption of the mortgage.

As a result, the vendor has an interest in how the land sold will be used in the future. Accordingly, a covenant assists in ensuring some element of control over the land sold for the benefit of the land being retained by the vendor.

Therefore, by its nature a restrictive covenant benefits the land of the covenantee at the expense of the covenantor''s land.

Accordingly, when the original covenantor sells the land on, he may still be liable for any breach of the covenant, but the purchaser will not. See In McNaul''s Estate [1902] 1 114. There were, however, a number of ways developed to get around the rule that the original covenantor should remain liable for the condition/promise viz., (a) Reciprocity Covenants - the rule in Halsall Brizell This is the principle that if someone enjoys the benefit of a covenant, he is also compelled both morally and legally to take on the burden. The case of Halsall Brizell [1957] 169 concerned a nineteenth-century housing development. Each of the conveyances granted the owners the right to use the access roads and other facilities. Each conveyance also included covenants whereby the owners agreed to pay a share of the maintenance costs for walls, roads, promenades, sewers and so on. The successors in title to the original covenantor refused to make any contributions on the basis that the burden of the covenant did not run with the land and could not be enforceable against them. The court held that it was ancient law that a man cannot take benefit under a deed without also subscribing to the obligations thereunder. The court held therefore that since the burden was intertwined with the enjoyment of a benefit (i.e., the right to the use of the amenities) and was granted in the same deed that conferred a benefit, it could be held to run with the land. The only qualification to this rule is that the burden of the covenant must be relevant to the exercise of the right. Where the two are not closely related it appears that the rule will not apply. Chain of Indemnities Since the original covenantor remains liable after parting with the land, he will generally require the purchaser to covenant to indemnify him against any future breaches. Usually, as in the assignment of a leasehold interest, the vendor of a freehold title will insist on an indemnity from the purchaser with regard to any covenants affecting the land in order to protect his interest. The purchaser indemnifies the vendor in respect of any action taken against him as a result of the purchaser breaching the covenants. In this way the original covenant can still be enforced against the land (albeit indirectly), even where there is a series of conveyances of the land and it can be said that the burden of the covenant runs with the land.'),

The covenantor must not use the property for a purpose inconsistent with the use for which it was originally granted but a court of equity does not and ought not enforce a covenant binding only in equity in such a way as to require the successors in title of the covenantor himself, they having entered into no covenant, to expend sums of money in accordance with what the original covenantor bound himself to do. Rhone Stephens (1994) 2 310 concerned a building which had been divided into two units, a house and a cottage. Part of the roof of the house overhung a bedroom in the cottage. The owner sold the cottage and retained the house. He covenanted in the deed of conveyance for himself and his successors in title to maintain the roof in wind and watertight condition. The plaintiff was a current owner of the cottage under a conveyance that had contained an express assignment of the covenant. The defendant was the successor in title of the original covenantor. The House of Lords held that the covenant could not be enforced against the defendant on the traditional basis that the burden of a positive covenant will not run with the land. In the case the Lords restated the position of equity regarding covenants in the following terms "Equity cannot compel an owner to comply with a positive covenant entered into by his predecessors in title without flatly contradicting the common law rule that a person cannot be made liable in contract unless he was a party to it. Enforcement of a positive covenant lies in contract; a positive covenant compels an owner to exercise his rights. Enforcement of a restrictive covenant lies in property; a negative covenant deprives the owner of a right over property. . . To enforce a positive covenant would be to enforce a personal obligation against a person who has not covenanted.

However, by restricting the use of the servient tenement a covenant may considerably enhance the value of the estates or interests in the dominant tenement. Typical examples are covenants not to develop the lands or not to use the lands for a particular purpose. While the common law will not generally allow the burden of a restrictive covenant to run with the land the position at equity is different. The most important development in restrictive covenants inequity was the development of the rule in Tulk Moxhay (1848) 2 774. This case was the first case in which the burden of a restrictive covenant was allowed to be enforced by successors in title. The case is authority for the proposition that the burden of a restrictive covenant "will run with the land" to which it relates so as to bind all successors in title of the original covenantor save a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. The case of Tulk Moxhay concerned a covenant to keep Leicester Square in an open state, uncovered with buildings. The House of Lords held that this was a negative or restrictive covenant even though it was phrased in positive terms. The question in that case was not whether or not the covenant ran with the land but rather whether a party shall be permitted to use the land in a manner inconsistent with the contract entered into by his vendor and of which he had notice when he purchased the property. In Craig Greer [1899] 1 258 the lessee covenanted with his lessor not to use buildings erected on the demised premises for any purpose other than as a dwelling house or tea rooms. The plaintiff was the successor in title of the lessor and the defendant was a sub-lessee of the covenantor. The defendant erected a large liquor store on the demised premises on the basis that the covenant had become obsolete. Chatterton said that the dispute was to be addressed according to the equitable principle that a person purchasing the land with notice of a covenant restricting its use in a particular way will be restrained from using the land in a manner inconsistent with the covenant. He concluded that the rule derived from Tulk Moxhay was confined to restrictive covenants and would not apply in cases where the covenant involved works of repair or improvement or required the expenditure of money.'),

Where there are successive assignments of the land then there must be an assignment of the benefit on each occasion. Annexation of the benefit of a restrictive covenant The covenant can be annexed to the land expressly where the document creating the covenant shows an intention to annex the covenant to the land. This is usually done in two ways: by an appropriate declaration that the covenant is entered into for the benefit of the land or describing the character of the covenantee in such a way as to clearly indicate that he is taking the covenant as owner or owner for the time being of the land in question. In order to successfully annex the benefit to the lands then it must be clear that the benefit of the covenant is annexed to the entire of the land and that the entire of the land is capable of benefiting from it. If the court construes the words of annexation as purporting to annex the benefit to the dominant land as an entirety the annexation will fail unless substantially the whole of the land is capable of benefiting. If part of the dominant land is then sold and the covenant was annexed to the dominant land as an entirety, then the benefit will not pass to the purchaser of the part unless there is an express assignment of same. The successor in title must hold substantially the whole part of the dominant land if he is to succeed in claiming the benefit of a covenant annexed to the land as a whole.

Under section 50 a Servient owner can apply to court for an order discharging or modifying a freehold covenant even where that covenant was entered into before the Act came into force. As mentioned above, the covenant can only be discharged if the court is satisfied that having to continue to comply with it amounts to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the servient land. The Court can consider a number of things when granting or refusing to grant this order. In this regard there are abroad range of factors that a Court can consider set out under section 50(2) those factors are as follows: (a) the circumstances in which the covenant was originally entered into; the purposes of the covenant originally; the time which has elapsed since then; a change in the character of the dominant land, the servient land or the character of the neighbourhood; any development plan for the area under the Planning and Development Act, 2000; if the covenant is of practical benefit to the dominant owner and the nature and extent of that benefit; if the covenant places an obligation on the servient owner to carry out works or pay towards the cost of works the court will look at whether complying with this obligation has become unduly onerous when compared with the benefit from compliance; whether the dominant owner has agreed, expressly or impliedly, to the covenant being discharged or varied; representations made by any person interested in the performance of the covenant; any other relevant matters. Under section 50(3) the court has discretion to allow for payment where the court finds that in granting an order it will result in a "quantifiable loss" to the dominant owner or other person, and accordingly the Court can order the servient owner to pay the dominant owner or other person compensation. section 50(4) of the 2009 Act makes registration of such an order compulsory.

The licence may arise by implication where such a licence is necessary for the performance of a contract between the parties. The licence can only be revoked in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, it has been held that a contractual licence will not bind third parties and successors in title of the licensor, even where they are on notice of its existence. Originally it was the case that a licensor could not be prevented from revoking the licence in breach of contract and that the only remedy open to the licensee was a claim for damages. However, in the case of Winter Garden Theatre (London) Ltd Millennium Productions Ltd [1948] 173 the Court held that the licensee could be granted an injunction to restrain the licensor from revoking a licence in breach of contract. Initially it was thought in the case of Errington Errington and Woods [1952] 1 290 that a contractual license was capable of giving rise to an equitable interest in property. Denning stated that the infusion of equity into the common law meant that a contractual license has a force and validity of its own and could not be revoked in breach of contract. He went on to hold that neither the licensor nor anyone who claims through him can disregard the license except a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. However, the decision in Errington was doubted in the case of Ashburn Anstalt Arnold [1989] 1. In this case the defendant entered into an agreement in 1973 to sell his leasehold interest in the property. The agreement provided that the vendor would be entitled to remain on the premises as a licensee for a certain period free of rent and thereafter would be subject to a provision that he be given notice of at least one quarter before giving up possession of the property. In 1985 the plaintiff purchased the freehold interest in the property subject to the 1973 agreement but brought proceedings seeking possession of the property. The House of Lords held that the 1973 agreement created a contractual license. However, the Lords went on to find that a contractual license alone would not be binding on a third party even where the third party took the property on notice of the license. In certain situations, the facts might give rise to a constructive trust, but those facts were not present in this case. The purchase of the land subject to the contractual license was not in itself enough to bind the third party.'),

The Courts have not settled on any particular hierarchy of the indicia, and in some cases place greater emphasis on one indicium over another. The indicia of a tenancy are: the construction of the agreement, the intention of the parties, exclusive possession; and rent. Although the court will take into consideration the label placed on the agreement by the parties, this will not be determinative. In the case of Irish Shell Costello [1981] ILRM 66 the Supreme Court held that the label on an agreement is not determinative and that the court must consider the true nature of the transaction. However, in determining the nature of the transaction the court should have regard to the intention of the parties. The case concerned an agreement for possession of a service station. The agreement was described as a license. There was no rent expressed in the agreement but there was a periodic payment of a hire charge for the use of the petrol pump equipment. There was also a clause prohibiting the assignment of the interest in the property which would not have been necessary or appropriate to a license. The court determined that what had been granted to the defendants in this case went far beyond a personal privilege to the occupier of the site and was more in the nature of a tenancy or lease. In Irish Shell Costello (No.2) [1984] 511 it was confirmed by Kenny in his judgment that in all cases it is a question of what the parties intended and that it is not permissible to apply an objective test which would impute to the parties an intention that they never in fact had.'),

Where an agreement does not grant exclusive possession, it will almost always be construed as a mere license. However, the fact that exclusive possession is granted is only one factor and is not conclusive evidence as to the existence of a lease. In National Maternity Hospital McGouran [1994] ILRM 521 Morris held that a clause in the agreement that negated exclusive possession was inconsistent with the nature of a lease, notwithstanding that the licensee was the sole keyholder. In Kenny Homes Leonard [1997] IEHC 230 the High Court again considered that a clause that negated exclusive possession meant that there was no lease and that there was no requirement to consider whether this clause was ever intended to be enforced in practice. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court. In the case of Smith Coras Iompair Eireann [2002] IEHC 103 Peart appeared to move away from the emphasis placed on the intention of the parties by the Supreme Court. There was a clause in the agreement excluding any right to a tenancy and it was established in evidence that both parties had understood at the outset that they were entering into a license agreement. However, the plaintiff had enjoyed the exclusive possession of the premises and the Court noted that the level of investment in the premises was inconsistent with a mere license. Accordingly, Peart held that the agreement should be construed as a tenancy and the plaintiff was entitled to the consequent statutory relief. It is difficult to reconcile Smith with section 3 of Deasy''s Act and the decision in Kenny Homes & Ltd Leonard. Moreover, whereas the Smith case involved a commercial arrangement, Peart put much weight on English authorities such as Street Mountford and Errington Errington Woods notwithstanding that they were dealing with residential arrangements. The current position appears to be that, if an occupier is granted exclusive possession of property by its owner in return for an agreement to pay rent, the courts will regard that occupier as a tenant. The difficulty in Mrs. McGouran''s case was that the terms of the agreement precluded exclusive possession on her part, insofar as they allowed her to be moved around the hospital and permitted the owner to enter her premises at will. In the contrasting case of Smith Coras Iompair Eireann, the Court held that an occupier of the "Tara Nova" shop at Tara Street station was a tenant because he was paying rent and had exclusive possession of the premises. Without expressly disagreeing with either the approach or conclusions of Peart in the Smith Irish Rail decision, there is evidence of a return to an approach of treating clearly negotiated terms entered into at "arm''s length" between the parties as being, prima facie at least, representative of the true nature of the relationship in the decision of McGovern in Esso Ireland Limited Nine One One Retail Limited [2013] IEHC 514. Here the Defendant operated food service facilities in 32 of the Plaintiffs'' petrol stations pursuant to an operating agreement. The Defendant refused to vacate on the termination of the operating agreement and claimed an entitlement to a new tenancy pursuant to the provisions of Part of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. The High Court rejected this contention on the basis that the Defendant was not a tenant pursuant to the agreement: The Licence Agreement clearly stated that no relationship of landlord and tenant existed or was intended to be created between the parties. While that does not, of itself, establish that there was no landlord and tenant relationship, the evidence in this case does not establish that the attributes of a tenancy agreement existed. The court should be slow to look behind the clear terms negotiated by the parties at arm''s length and in circumstances where each was legally represented. The terms of the Operating Agreement and Licence could not have been clearer. There are no facts surrounding the defendant''s occupation of the premises which would entitle the court to say this is a tenancy agreement, in circumstances where they have both agreed that no landlord and tenant relationship shall arise. The facts in this case completely accord with the nature of the relationship as stated by the parties in their written agreement. In the circumstances, hold that there was no tenancy agreement and it follows that the defendant is not entitled to claim a new tenancy under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980. Irish courts, in theory, also require the "intention to create a landlord tenant relationship" before a tenancy can arise. This is a somewhat nebulous concept and at present appears to be found to be present where there is rent and exclusive possession, even if the agreement is specifically described as a licence rather than a tenancy. At the moment, following, Smith Coras Iompair Eireann most permissive occupiers will be tenants and as such potentially able to avail of rights under the 1980 Act. However, it should not be automatically assumed that an occupier is a tenant without checking the terms of the occupation agreement under which that occupier holds the property, in order to make sure that exclusive possession is granted, and rent required.'),

Therefore, a lease in excess of one year must be in writing. A lease of less than one-year duration can be made orally. It is less clear whether a lease for a fixed period of one year needs to be in writing. Where the necessary formal requirements are not met there will not be a legal tenancy between the parties. However, equity can give recognition to such an arrangement under the Rule in Walsh Lonsdale (1882) 21 9. The rule in this case states that where there is a concluded contract to grant a lease and if the requirements of the Statute of Frauds have been satisfied or if there are sufficient acts of part performance, then specific performance of the lease may be granted in order to enforce it. The rule is often referred to by the saying that "an agreement for a lease is as good as a lease". A contract for the grant of a lease will require a note or memorandum in writing in accordance with section 2 of the Statute of Frauds 1695. Section 51 of the 2009 Act repeals and reenacts section 2 of the Statute of Frauds, 1695, but only in so far as it relates to contract for the sale or other disposition of land. It does not, it seems, effect a change in the law relating to the written requirements for a contract and the enforcement of a contract is still subject to equitable doctrines. The note or memorandum need not contain all the terms but must contain the "material" terms. These must include the terms as to the parties, property, price and any other term which the parties consider essential. In general, if anything has been actively discussed it will then be a material term, as will any other important matter which the parties must have thought of as important. In the absence of any note or memorandum the parties may be able to rely on the equitable doctrine of part performance. However, in the absence of compliance with section 4 of Deasy''s Act, all that will result is an equitable lease. An equitable lease does not create the privity of estate that is essential to enable the enforcement of covenants in the lease as between the successors of both the landlord and the tenant. Furthermore, an equitable lease must rely on the remedy of specific performance to be enforced and specific performance is a discretionary remedy.'),

Note that it is important to have covenants regarding rent and exclusive possession in the Lease, otherwise the agreement may not qualify as a Lease. When interpreting the precise meaning of an express covenant, the general principles of interpretation of a contract are used. The effect of express covenants may on occasion be modified by statute, for example sections 66, 67 and 68 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. In order to avail of this protection, the tenant must be holding a tenement. This is an important concept in Landlord and Tenant legislation and is defined in the 1980 Act as a property which consists wholly or partly of buildings and in which any part of the property that is not so covered by buildings is subsidiary and ancillary to the buildings. The seminal judgment in relation to the phrase "subsidiary and ancillary" is Killeen Baron Talbot Malahide [1951] Jur. Rep. 17 which was endorsed in Maureen Chaloner Smith Raymond and Claire Nardone [2009] IECC 2 (Circuit Court, White July 13, 2009) where it was held: "The words ''ancillary and subsidiary'' require the giving or doing or something actively benefiting the house and are not satisfied by proof that the land is aesthetically advantageous to the building" Section 66: Section 66 deals with the usual covenants found in a lease that prohibit assignment or sub-letting without the consent of the landlord and the section provides that the landlord can only withhold his consent reasonably. In addressing this provision, the courts have found that where a landlord has a doubt as to the solvency of a proposed assignee, he will be acting reasonably in refusing consent and he can also reasonably refuse his consent in the interests of good estate management. The issue of whether a lessee is entitled to damages following the lessor''s unreasonable refusal to consent to assignment was discussed recently in Meagher & Ors. Luke Healy Pharmacy Limited [2010] IEHC 40. The Supreme Court held that Treloar Bigge [1874] L.R. 9 Exch. 151 represented the law in Ireland and section 66 did not change the law in Ireland relating to withholding consent. The effect of section 66 is not to impose a statutory duty but rather to regulate the construction of covenants entered into between the lessor and lessee. Had the Oireachtas intended to confer upon a lessee a cause of action where none had previously existed, it would have done so in clear and unambiguous terms. The lessee, therefore, has no right of action in damages against the lessors by reason of the lessors having unreasonably withheld their consent. A tenant would only have a right to damages where there was an express covenant by the landlord in the lease in this regard. See also Perfect Pies Ltd. & anor Chupn Ltd. [2015] IEHC 692 where the Defendant landlord was found to have been unreasonable withholding of consent to the assignment of a commercial lease. This case considered a landlord potentially seeking to use the opportunity of an application for consent to assignment to pursue "ulterior motives" - in this case, to obtain possession of the premises. Section 67: Section 67 provides similarly that the landlord cannot withhold his consent to a particular user of the property unless he is acting reasonably in doing so. It appears from the case law that good estate management will be an acceptable basis upon which to refuse to consent to a change of user. In Irish Glass Bottle Limited Dublin Port [2005] IEHC 89 Carrol set out the principles to be applied deriving for the various decided cases on whether consent to change of user is unreasonably withheld. The landlord''s motive in withholding consent is relevant. A recent example can be found in Dunnes Stores Irish Life (Unreported, High Court, Clarke April 2008). The case concerned the use of premises in the Ilac Shopping Centre in Dublin. Dunnes leased the property from Irish Life and wished to change the use from drapery to food hall. The lease contained a clause restricting change of use without the landlord''s consent and preventing the landlord from withholding its consent unreasonably. Dunnes argued that the reason given by Irish Life for withholding consent - namely the "vision and image" of the property - was disingenuous and that the refusal to consent was really being used as a means to force Dunnes to relinquish possession of part of the property. Clarke found that Irish Life had improperly taken into account the possibility of using refusal of consent as leverage for the purposes of seeking to secure possession of the property. Section 68: A covenant in a lease of a tenement absolutely prohibiting the making of any improvement, as defined by section 67(3) of the act, has effect as if it were a covenant prohibiting improvements without the licence or consent of the lessor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.'),

Notwithstanding the condition the tenant/defendants had served a notice of intention to claim relief in response to the Plaintiff''s Equity Civil Bill for overholding. Although the tenants had been in occupation of the premises from 1955 to 2004 when the lease expired, Clarke held that the landlord had good and sufficient reason for refusing to renew the lease pursuant to the terms of the 1980 Act. the good and sufficient reasons were that the tenants had failed to keep the premises in good repair and were unable to do so. Once the tenant can show that he has acquired the right then the new tenancy can be granted either by agreement, or where this is not possible the Court will fix the terms of the new tenancy. Where the Court has to fix the terms of the new tenancy it cannot fix the lease for a term of less than five years or for more than thirty-five years. Where the new tenancy has arisen on foot of a business equity then the term should not be more than twenty years. The Court will also fix a new rent, and this must be the rent that a willing tenant not already in possession would be willing to pay and a landlord would be willing to accept on the basis of vacant possession of the property. The new rent can be fixed to take account of improvements made to the property by the tenant.'),

They are as follows: Subsection 1: The building is erected by the tenant or his predecessor in title under the lease, either during their tenancy or in anticipation of the tenancy, for example, if the lease contained a covenant to erect buildings. Subsection 2: If the lease is for more than fifty years and the rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property and there is presumption that the buildings were erected by the tenant or his predecessors in title. In Hanlon Limited Sepia Limited, High Court unreported, of January, 1982, Keane delivered an oral judgment that the lessor had to rebut the presumption that the buildings were erected by the tenant or predecessor in title and on hearing evidence given the onus of proof had to be greater than the balance of probability (the civil standard). However, in Barry Registrar of Titles [1992] ILRM 62, MacKenzie reverted to the civil standard rejecting a strict onus of proof, stating that he regarded in civil cases that the Court could do no more than consider a case proved if probably correct and if there were two cases and one is more probable, the more probable succeeds.

This came about in circumstances where it was recognised that many houses in towns in Ireland had been built by lessees who did not hold under a substantial lease or sub-lease, but rather under an oral yearly tenancy, which may always have been oral, or may have arisen on expiry of an earlier lease. In any event, many such tenancies were of significant duration to the extent that it could be said that the tenants had acquired an ''equity'' in the houses that had been built. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 3) Act, 1967 first conferred the right to acquire the fee simple on yearly tenants by themselves or with their predecessors in title. This Act has been substantially amended by the 1978 Act, and later by the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1984 and most recently by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act 2019. Section 15(1)(a) requires that the land is covered wholly or partly by permanent buildings and any land not so covered is subsidiary and ancillary to those buildings. Section requires that the land is held under a contract of yearly tenancy or under a yearly tenancy arising by operation of law or by inference on the expiration of a lease or under a statutory tenancy implied by holding over property on expiration of a lease which reserves a yearly rent. Section requires that the land has been continuously held under any one or more of the tenancies referred to in paragraph (including any expired lease) by the person or his predecessors in title for a period of not less than twenty-five years prior to the date of service by the person of Notice of Intention to Acquire the Fee Simple. Note: The twenty-five-year period of occupation may include any period during which the tenant held under an expired lease. Also, the 1978 Act dropped the requirement that the premises should constitute a ''tenement'' (formerly in the 1967 Act where continuous occupation of the tenant was also required). Therefore, the purchasing tenant is no longer required to be in occupation of the premises at the time of purchase, meaning that any twenty five-year period prior to purchase is sufficient. Section requires that either: the yearly rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property or it is proved that the permanent buildings were erected by the tenant or by his predecessor in title. Section requires that the permanent buildings were not erected by the immediate lessor or any superior lessor or any of their predecessors in title provided, however, that it be presumed until the contrary is proved, that the permanent buildings were not so erected. Note: the 1967 Act required the buildings to have been erected by the occupying tenant or his predecessors with a rebuttable presumption that they were so erected. On the contrary the 1978 Act requires that they were not erected by the lessors or his predecessors with a rebuttable presumption that this is so. Section 15(2) - (5) deal with situations where the yearly tenant would otherwise be excluded because the un-built on portion of the land is not subsidiary and ancillary to the buildings. The land can be treated as two holdings, a built on holding in respect of which the right to acquire the fee simple can be exercised, and a vacant holding in respect of which no such right exists.'),

Once these elements are in place, a binding contract will come into existence between the parties. Where the contract is for the sale of land or for any interest in land the contract must be evidenced in writing in accordance with section 51 of the 2009 Act. Section 51 repeals and re-enacts section 2 of the Statute of Frauds (Ireland) 1695 so far as it relates to contracts for the sale of land. Section 51 makes clear that a contract for the sale of land shall not be enforceable unless there is a note or memorandum in writing recording the agreement, signed by the person against whom the agreement is to be enforced or their lawfully authorised agent. Section 51(3) states that for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to an express provision in the contract to the contrary, payment of a deposit in money or money''s worth is not necessary for an enforceable contract, thus quieting concerns on this point since Boyle Lee [1992] 555. The note or memorandum must contain the essential elements of the agreement such as the parties, the property, the purchase price agreed and a statement of any other terms the parties consider important. As the intention of the parties is not a requirement for the creation of a note or memorandum same can be created inadvertently. Because of this situation the practice among solicitors is that any correspondence between vendor and purchaser prior to the contract should be marked with the words "Subject to Contract/Contract Denied". The courts have held that the presence of these words on a document is inconsistent with the existence of a fully concluded contract. This is especially important where a letter from a solicitor for either party might be deemed to be a note or memorandum under the Statute of Frauds or the 2009 Act with the effect of making any prior agreement to sell the lands enforceable. Section 51 (2) of the 2009 Act makes clear that requirements under subsection 1 do not affect the law relating to part performance or other equitable doctrines (presumably estoppel-type situations).'),

The purchaser takes the property as it stands. The vendor is not under any duty at law to disclose physical defects in the land. Therefore, the purchaser should have the property fully surveyed before signing the contract so as to disclose any defects. If the purchaser decides not to do this, his solicitor must make sure that he has discharged his duty to advise him or her of the situation. It is prudent to record this advice in writing and place a copy of the letter on the file. It is a bad practice to insert a condition in the contract to the effect that the sale is subject to the purchaser obtaining a satisfactory survey of the property as the phrase ''satisfactory survey'' is difficult to define. Where the property is only in the course of being built, the physical condition of the property will be regulated by the building contract. Therefore, the purchaser should not accept a contract for sale of the lands without a copy of the building contract. The purchaser should examine the planning status of adjoining properties. He or she should consider whether local authority projects such as road widening are likely to affect the property. Again, if the purchaser decides not to do so his or her solicitor should advise in writing and place a copy of the letter on the file. The vendor is held not to give any warranty as to a water supply to a property. The purchaser must establish that the necessary easements and way-leaves are in place in order to support the provision of a water supply to the property. Generally, this will only apply to properties situate on their own lands in a rural or semi-rural location. The vendor is not deemed to give any warranty that there is appropriate access to the property from a roadway. The purchaser must also establish that he will enjoy a right of way either by grant or by prescription or that the property abuts the public roadway thereby enjoying direct access without requiring a right of way. The purchaser must satisfy himself that other services such as sewage are available to the property, either by virtue of the existence of a septic tank on the property or by having piped access to a sewage system on foot of appropriate way-leaves if the pipes cross the property of other landowners. Where there are outgoings in relation to the property these should be ascertained at the pre-contract stage.

In relation to physical defects, the caveat emptor principle applies in full. It will also apply to the extent that the vendor is not under a duty to disclose patent defects in the title. Patent defects are those which would be reasonably discoverable by the purchaser from either an inspection of the land or the title documents or which are otherwise obvious from facts brought to his attention. In the case of Flanagan & McGarvey & Thomson''s Contract [1945] 32 the court confirmed that it is well settled that the purchaser of property must take the property subject to any defects which are patent on inspection and are not inconsistent with the description contained in the contract for sale. To be a patent defect the defect must either be visible to the eye or arise by necessary implication from something so visible. In that case the existence of a path leading from the road to the back door of a house indicated as a practical certainty to anyone who saw it that the person who occupied the house would have a right of way over the lands. In relation to the question of persons other than the vendor who may be in occupation of the land, the general principle is that the fact of occupation puts a purchaser on constructive notice of the rights and interests (if any) of the person or persons in occupation. Therefore, where the purchaser is on notice of persons other than the vendor in occupation, he is under a duty of inquiry that supersedes the vendor''s duty to disclose. If both the vendor and purchaser remain silent in relation to the question, then the purchaser takes the land subject to all existing rights. The vendor''s duty of disclosure arises in relation to latent defects in the title that is, those defects which are not obvious to the eye from an inspection of the property. It has been held that the vendor is obliged to disclose only those latent defects of which he is aware or of which he should have been aware. In General Condition 31 the vendor is required to ensure that the purchaser receives notice before the sale of the various matters affecting the property and set out therein. Failure to show that the purchaser received notice or was aware of any of these matters will entitle the purchaser to rescind the contract before completion and claim the return of his deposit under General Condition 33.'),

Most rural and new suburban land is registered in the Land Registry while much old urban land remains registered in the Registry of Deeds. From the November 2006 both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds were under the control of the Property Registration Authority established under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act, 2006. Since the March 2023 the Property Registration Authority, along with the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland, is under the control of Tailte Éireann established under the provisions of Tailte Éireann Act 2022. The Land Registry provides for the registration of ownership of land. Where land is registered a search in the land registry will disclose information of the ownership with the result that title investigation for conveyancers is greatly simplified. In short, the registry consists of a list of owners of land with particulars of the properties owned and of the charges and restrictions affecting the said property. The Registry is kept up to date and the register is conclusive as to the title therein. A high proportion of agricultural land is registered. This is because all land purchased under the Land Purchase Acts was subject to mandatory registration in the land registry, and therefore all subsequent dealings with the free hold title had to be and continue to be carried out under the registered system. The effect of this was to greatly simplify the conveyancing of most agricultural land in the state. The Registry of Deeds confirms the existence of a deed, its due execution and its priority. However, it does not confirm the validity of the title of any person who claims to have an interest in the property. When dealing with a particular title it is important to establish at the outset whether the title is registered or unregistered as this will determine the different procedures that must be employed in investigating the title and in disposing of an interest in the property.'),

The Land Registry shows evidence not merely of the existence of a deed in relation to property but as to the nature and extent of the interest dealt with, disposed of or acquired under such a deed. Initial registration in the Land Registry is compulsory where unregistered property is purchased in the state after 1 June 2011 in the following cases, Land bought under the Land Purchase Acts, land acquired after January 1967 by a statutory authority, land sold in Counties Carlow, Meath. Laois from 1 January 1970, land sold in Counties Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon from 1 April 2006, from October 2008, compulsory registration was extended to six additional counties, Clare, Kilkenny, Louth, Sligo, Wexford and Wicklow (S.I. 81 of 2008), with effect from 1 January 2010, compulsory registration was extended to the following additional counties; Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Monaghan, North Tipperary, Offaly, South Tipperary and Waterford and cities Galway, Limerick and Waterford (S.I. 176 of 2009), From 1 June 2011, compulsory registration was extended to the cities and counties of Cork and Dublin (S.I. 516 of 2010). Once title has been registered in the land registry it carries with it a State guarantee as to its validity. The Register is deemed to be conclusive evidence of title and conclusive evidence of any right, privilege, appurtenance or burden appearing on the title (with the exception of certain burdens set out in section 72 of the 1964 Act which are capable of affecting the land without being registered). The register of title in the Land Registry is shown on a Folio that relates to each particular property. Each Folio contains a description of the property, the name of the registered owner and the capacity in which they hold the land and a list of any burdens or charges that affect the land and are capable of registration under section 69. The Land Registry holds File Plans showing the extent of the property registered on the folio. (these File Plans are updated with Ordnance Survey map detail). Each Folio will have a File Plan attached to it showing the boundaries of the property. However, it is important to remember that this is not deemed to be conclusive as to the extent of the lands or the boundaries. Property registered in the Land Registry is disposed of and acquired by means of a deed of transfer. Both freehold and leasehold property can be transferred once it is registered in the Land Registry. Under the provisions of the 1964 Act, the title to registered land only passes on the registration of a deed of transfer and not at the date of its execution. Therefore, once a property has been registered in the Land Registry, every subsequent disposal of an interest in the property must be registered on the folio opened in respect of the particular property in question. The date upon which an application for registration is lodged will be the date of registration. Most of the documents lodged in the Land Registry in relation to any disposition of property will be retained by the Land Registry when the application has been completed and the folio will be updated to reflect the new position. Therefore, in general the only title document required in respect of a registered property will be a certified copy of the folio. This means that conveyancing procedures will usually be less complex and more efficient in relation to registered property, compared to property that is unregistered. In order to show that he is entitled to occupy land or that he is entitled to dispose of land, a person must be able to show that he has a good title to that land.'),

The register shows only the existence and due execution of documents relating to a particular property. It does not provide any evidence as to the nature or quality of the title to that property. It merely establishes an order of priority as between the different deeds or documents that relate to a particular property. Registration in the Registry of Deeds is not compulsory, however, where a person does not register a deed or document under which they have acquired an interest in property then they may lose priority to a deed which, although executed subsequently, has been registered. Registration is not necessary to transfer the title to the property. Title is transferred when the deed of the purchase has been delivered and the purchase monies paid over. The Registry of Deeds is not concerned with the effectiveness or validity of the deed or document that is presented for registration once it complies with certain basic formal requirements. Although the Statute gives priority to a registered deed over an un-registered deed (notwithstanding their respective dates of execution) the courts have intervened to ensure that the provisions of the statute are not used to perpetrate a fraud. Where a party acting on foot of a registered deed has actual notice of a prior unregistered deed, he will not be permitted to avail of the protection offered by the statute (see O''Connor McCarthy [1982] 161). A lease for a term less than 21 years granting actual possession of the property is not registerable under the provisions of the Statute. The purchaser is expected to ascertain that the property is in the possession of someone other than the vendor and to make appropriate enquiries. A deed is registered in the Registry of Deeds by means of a memorial. A memorial is an extract from the deed containing details such as the date of the deed, the names and addresses of the parties, the nature of the deed, the effect of the deed and a full description of the property. It will also be noted on the memorial that the deed has been duly executed and the memorial itself should be executed by the vendor or their disposing party. In practice it will be sufficient if the memorial is executed by any of the parties to the execution of the deed. The execution of the memorial must be witnessed by two persons, one of whom must also have been a witness to the execution of the deed. The memorial contains an affidavit of an attesting witness which must be sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths or a practising solicitor. Once the memorial has been executed and stamped it is presented to the Registry of Deeds where it will be compared with the original deed. If the memorial is in order the deed will be stamped with details of registration and returned to the applicant and the memorial will be retained in the Registry of Deeds where it can be referenced in the future. From May 2008, the memorial has been replaced by prescribed Registry of Deeds application forms which are available on www.tailte.ie. The Registry of Deeds keeps an index of lands up to 1947 in which it is possible to carry out a search against a particular property by its description. After 1947 there is only an index of names in the Registry of Deeds. The index contains only the name of the vendor or disposing party in relation to a particular deed. It is important when searching in the index of names to ascertain the correct name and spelling of the party. Since 1970, records have been held electronically and can be searched online on www.landdirect.ie. The Registry of Deeds will provide two kinds of official search in its records. A negative search is carried out by two officials who cross-reference their results and is fully guaranteed by the registry. A common search is carried out by one official only. A search is made in the Registry of Deeds against a party from the date upon which that party acquired the property in question until such time as the deed under which they dispose of their interest was registered in the Registry of Deeds. A hand search is a search carried out by a professional searcher in the Registry of Deeds and is used to bring negative searches up-to-date or to fill in gaps between official searches.'),

By Release This occurs where the dominant owner agrees to release the servient lands from the burden of the easement. A release can be either express or implied. At common law an express release must be executed by way of deed. However, in equity, a person who releases his entitlement to an easement in a less formal manner, for example, in writing or by oral agreement supported by acts of part performance, may be estopped from later relying on the easement (Cook Mayor of Bath (1868) 6 177). (iii)By Non-User This will only result in the extinguishment of the easement where an intention to abandon can be proved, that is, where it can be shown that the person entitled to the easement has ceased to enjoy the easement with the intention of relinquishing the right permanently. The Courts have held that in order to abandon a right of way, there must be a fixed intention never again to assert the right (Tehidy Minerals Norman [1971] 2 Q.B. 528). Non-user of a right of way, while it can be evidence of an intention to release or abandon the easement, is never in itself sufficient evidence for that purpose (Carroll Sheridan [1984] I.L.R.M. 451). Because a right of way is a valuable property right, the courts will not lightly find that such a right has been released or abandoned (Orwell Park Management Ltd. Henihan [2004] IEHC 87 (Unreported, High Court, Herbert May 2004)). In Benn Hardinge (1992) 66 & C.R. 346, the Court of Appeal declined to find an intention on the part of the dominant owner to abandon a right of way even though no use had been made of that right of way for more than 175 years because the owner of the dominant tenement had other means of access to the land. In Peilow Ffrench O''Carroll (1972) 106 I.L.T.R. 30 at 49, Budd held that allowing a lane to become overgrown and lately to be blocked by a gate did not suffice to show an intention to abandon a right of way already acquired. Such an intention to abandon may be presumed after 20 years of non-use but the courts will be reluctant to allow this presumption without supporting evidence. The presumption will also arise where the easement has been replaced by an alternative right (Smith Wilson [1903] 2 45). Section 39 of the 2009 Act made provision for the extinguishment of easements or profits prendre however section 39 of the 2009 Act was repealed by section 6 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2021.

Since domestic rates were abolished by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 and section 115 of the Valuation Act , 2001 declared that domestic premises ''shall not be rateable'', the Circuit Court lost jurisdiction in respect of such premises because under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 that jurisdiction was specifically linked to rateable value in land transactions.

Most often freehold covenants are used by a vendor selling part of his land where there remains a physical connection between the two pieces of land. As a result, the vendor has an interest in how the land sold will be used in the future. Accordingly, a covenant assists in ensuring some element of control over the land sold for the benefit of the land being retained by the vendor. A covenant has been described by Wylie as "a promise under seal, i.e., contained in a deed, and like all contractual obligations is enforceable between the parties according to the normal rules of contract law" (Wylie, Irish Land Law, Edition, para 21.01). Like a normal contract, the deed or lease can be enforced between the original parties to the contract. Any covenants in these documents are enforced under the law of contract. Therefore, a covenant entered into between the original parties remains enforceable between them and their personal representatives, as it would if it bore no relation to land. Section 49 (6) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009 specifically provides that the alterations to the rules on the enforceability of freehold covenants does not affect the enforceability of a covenant under the doctrine of privity of contract.

Accordingly, when the original covenantor sells the land on, he may still be liable for any breach of the covenant, but the purchaser will not. See In McNaul''s Estate [1902] 1 114. There were, however, a number of ways developed to get around the rule that the original covenantor should remain liable for the condition/promise viz., (a) Reciprocity Covenants - the rule in Halsall Brizell This is the principle that if someone enjoys the benefit of a covenant, he is also compelled both morally and legally to take on the burden. The case of Halsall Brizell [1957] 169 concerned a nineteenth-century housing development. Each of the conveyances granted the owners the right to use the access roads and other facilities. Each conveyance also included covenants whereby the owners agreed to pay a share of the maintenance costs for walls, roads, promenades, sewers and so on. The successors in title to the original covenantor refused to make any contributions on the basis that the burden of the covenant did not run with the land and could not be enforceable against them. The court held that it was ancient law that a man cannot take benefit under a deed without also subscribing to the obligations thereunder. The court held therefore that since the burden was intertwined with the enjoyment of a benefit (i.e., the right to the use of the amenities) and was granted in the same deed that conferred a benefit, it could be held to run with the land. The only qualification to this rule is that the burden of the covenant must be relevant to the exercise of the right. Where the two are not closely related it appears that the rule will not apply. Chain of Indemnities Since the original covenantor remains liable after parting with the land, he will generally require the purchaser to covenant to indemnify him against any future breaches. Usually, as in the assignment of a leasehold interest, the vendor of a freehold title will insist on an indemnity from the purchaser with regard to any covenants affecting the land in order to protect his interest. The purchaser indemnifies the vendor in respect of any action taken against him as a result of the purchaser breaching the covenants. In this way the original covenant can still be enforced against the land (albeit indirectly), even where there is a series of conveyances of the land and it can be said that the burden of the covenant runs with the land.'),

The person seeking to enforce the covenant must hold the dominant land. He cannot enforce the covenant if he has parted with ownership of the land, even where he is the original covenantee. 4. The person seeking to enforce the covenant must show, if he is a successor in title to the original covenantee that the benefit of the covenant has passed to him by assignment, annexation or on the basis of a local scheme. Assignment In order for assignment to take place the covenant must have been assigned to the successor in title at the same time as the grant or conveyance of the land. Once the connection between the covenant and the land is severed then the covenant will be regarded as being spent. The assignment can be made expressly in the conveyance by words showing an intention that the covenant should be assigned. Where there are successive assignments of the land then there must be an assignment of the benefit on each occasion. Annexation of the benefit of a restrictive covenant The covenant can be annexed to the land expressly where the document creating the covenant shows an intention to annex the covenant to the land. This is usually done in two ways: by an appropriate declaration that the covenant is entered into for the benefit of the land or describing the character of the covenantee in such a way as to clearly indicate that he is taking the covenant as owner or owner for the time being of the land in question. In order to successfully annex the benefit to the lands then it must be clear that the benefit of the covenant is annexed to the entire of the land and that the entire of the land is capable of benefiting from it. If the court construes the words of annexation as purporting to annex the benefit to the dominant land as an entirety the annexation will fail unless substantially the whole of the land is capable of benefiting. If part of the dominant land is then sold and the covenant was annexed to the dominant land as an entirety, then the benefit will not pass to the purchaser of the part unless there is an express assignment of same.

There has been no statutory power to discharge or modify a restrictive covenant without the consent of the person entitled to the benefit of it. However, section 50 of the 2009 Act enables a person whose land is subject to a restrictive covenant to apply to the court for the discharge or modification of the covenant on the basis that continued compliance with it would constitute an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. The court on such an application will have regard to the change in character of the land, the extent of the benefit, if any, that it still secures, whether its observance has become unduly onerous for the person whose land is affected and any other matter that the court may consider relevant. The court will have power to order the payment of compensation in a suitable case. An order made by the court should then be registered in the Registry of Deeds or Land Registry as appropriate. Discharge and modification of restrictive covenants Section 50 sets out new provisions dealing with discharging covenants - where such covenants are unworkable or have become obsolete with the passage of time. Section 50 applies to all covenants and an applicant has three options namely(a) Completely discharge Covenant Partially discharge Covenant Modify terms of Covenant The test to be applied is whether the continued operation of the covenant would constitute an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. Under section 50 a Servient owner can apply to court for an order discharging or modifying a freehold covenant even where that covenant was entered into before the Act came into force. As mentioned above, the covenant can only be discharged if the court is satisfied that having to continue to comply with it amounts to an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the servient land. The Court can consider a number of things when granting or refusing to grant this order. In this regard there are abroad range of factors that a Court can consider set out under section 50(2) those factors are as follows: (a) the circumstances in which the covenant was originally entered into; the purposes of the covenant originally; the time which has elapsed since then; a change in the character of the dominant land, the servient land or the character of the neighbourhood; any development plan for the area under the Planning and Development Act, 2000; if the covenant is of practical benefit to the dominant owner and the nature and extent of that benefit; if the covenant places an obligation on the servient owner to carry out works or pay towards the cost of works the court will look at whether complying with this obligation has become unduly onerous when compared with the benefit from compliance; whether the dominant owner has agreed, expressly or impliedly, to the covenant being discharged or varied; representations made by any person interested in the performance of the covenant; any other relevant matters. Under section 50(3) the court has discretion to allow for payment where the court finds that in granting an order it will result in a "quantifiable loss" to the dominant owner or other person, and accordingly the Court can order the servient owner to pay the dominant owner or other person compensation. section 50(4) of the 2009 Act makes registration of such an order compulsory.

As can be seen from this definition it does not appear to be necessary in Ireland for a landlord to hold any reversion, that is, a provision for the land to revert to the landlord. It is possible under the provisions of Deasy''s Act to create a lease that will last for ever. However, even where he does not retain a reversion, Gordon Phelan (1881) 15 ILTR 70 is authority for the view that a landlord retains a common law right of distress whereby he can retake possession of the property on non-payment of rent. Because the landlord holds a reversion, a concurrent lease can be granted at common law. This arises where the landlord grants a lease to A and simultaneously grants a lease of the same property to This creates a situation where is interposed between the landlord and A. becomes the immediate tenant of the landlord and A is the immediate tenant of This device is a disposition of his reversion to by the landlord.

Where an agreement does not grant exclusive possession, it will almost always be construed as a mere license. However, the fact that exclusive possession is granted is only one factor and is not conclusive evidence as to the existence of a lease. In National Maternity Hospital McGouran [1994] ILRM 521 Morris held that a clause in the agreement that negated exclusive possession was inconsistent with the nature of a lease, notwithstanding that the licensee was the sole keyholder. In Kenny Homes Leonard [1997] IEHC 230 the High Court again considered that a clause that negated exclusive possession meant that there was no lease and that there was no requirement to consider whether this clause was ever intended to be enforced in practice. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court. In the case of Smith Coras Iompair Eireann [2002] IEHC 103 Peart appeared to move away from the emphasis placed on the intention of the parties by the Supreme Court. There was a clause in the agreement excluding any right to a tenancy and it was established in evidence that both parties had understood at the outset that they were entering into a license agreement. However, the plaintiff had enjoyed the exclusive possession of the premises and the Court noted that the level of investment in the premises was inconsistent with a mere license. Accordingly, Peart held that the agreement should be construed as a tenancy and the plaintiff was entitled to the consequent statutory relief. It is difficult to reconcile Smith with section 3 of Deasy''s Act and the decision in Kenny Homes & Ltd Leonard. Moreover, whereas the Smith case involved a commercial arrangement, Peart put much weight on English authorities such as Street Mountford and Errington Errington Woods notwithstanding that they were dealing with residential arrangements. The current position appears to be that, if an occupier is granted exclusive possession of property by its owner in return for an agreement to pay rent, the courts will regard that occupier as a tenant. The difficulty in Mrs. McGouran''s case was that the terms of the agreement precluded exclusive possession on her part, insofar as they allowed her to be moved around the hospital and permitted the owner to enter her premises at will. In the contrasting case of Smith Coras Iompair Eireann, the Court held that an occupier of the "Tara Nova" shop at Tara Street station was a tenant because he was paying rent and had exclusive possession of the premises. Without expressly disagreeing with either the approach or conclusions of Peart in the Smith Irish Rail decision, there is evidence of a return to an approach of treating clearly negotiated terms entered into at "arm''s length" between the parties as being, prima facie at least, representative of the true nature of the relationship in the decision of McGovern in Esso Ireland Limited Nine One One Retail Limited [2013] IEHC 514. Here the Defendant operated food service facilities in 32 of the Plaintiffs'' petrol stations pursuant to an operating agreement. The Defendant refused to vacate on the termination of the operating agreement and claimed an entitlement to a new tenancy pursuant to the provisions of Part of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. The High Court rejected this contention on the basis that the Defendant was not a tenant pursuant to the agreement: The Licence Agreement clearly stated that no relationship of landlord and tenant existed or was intended to be created between the parties. While that does not, of itself, establish that there was no landlord and tenant relationship, the evidence in this case does not establish that the attributes of a tenancy agreement existed. The court should be slow to look behind the clear terms negotiated by the parties at arm''s length and in circumstances where each was legally represented. The terms of the Operating Agreement and Licence could not have been clearer. There are no facts surrounding the defendant''s occupation of the premises which would entitle the court to say this is a tenancy agreement, in circumstances where they have both agreed that no landlord and tenant relationship shall arise. The facts in this case completely accord with the nature of the relationship as stated by the parties in their written agreement. In the circumstances, hold that there was no tenancy agreement and it follows that the defendant is not entitled to claim a new tenancy under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980. Irish courts, in theory, also require the "intention to create a landlord tenant relationship" before a tenancy can arise. This is a somewhat nebulous concept and at present appears to be found to be present where there is rent and exclusive possession, even if the agreement is specifically described as a licence rather than a tenancy. At the moment, following, Smith Coras Iompair Eireann most permissive occupiers will be tenants and as such potentially able to avail of rights under the 1980 Act. However, it should not be automatically assumed that an occupier is a tenant without checking the terms of the occupation agreement under which that occupier holds the property, in order to make sure that exclusive possession is granted, and rent required.'),

Therefore, a lease in excess of one year must be in writing. A lease of less than one-year duration can be made orally. It is less clear whether a lease for a fixed period of one year needs to be in writing. Where the necessary formal requirements are not met there will not be a legal tenancy between the parties. However, equity can give recognition to such an arrangement under the Rule in Walsh Lonsdale (1882) 21 9. The rule in this case states that where there is a concluded contract to grant a lease and if the requirements of the Statute of Frauds have been satisfied or if there are sufficient acts of part performance, then specific performance of the lease may be granted in order to enforce it. The rule is often referred to by the saying that "an agreement for a lease is as good as a lease". A contract for the grant of a lease will require a note or memorandum in writing in accordance with section 2 of the Statute of Frauds 1695. Section 51 of the 2009 Act repeals and reenacts section 2 of the Statute of Frauds, 1695, but only in so far as it relates to contract for the sale or other disposition of land. It does not, it seems, effect a change in the law relating to the written requirements for a contract and the enforcement of a contract is still subject to equitable doctrines. The note or memorandum need not contain all the terms but must contain the "material" terms. These must include the terms as to the parties, property, price and any other term which the parties consider essential. In general, if anything has been actively discussed it will then be a material term, as will any other important matter which the parties must have thought of as important. In the absence of any note or memorandum the parties may be able to rely on the equitable doctrine of part performance. However, in the absence of compliance with section 4 of Deasy''s Act, all that will result is an equitable lease. An equitable lease does not create the privity of estate that is essential to enable the enforcement of covenants in the lease as between the successors of both the landlord and the tenant. Furthermore, an equitable lease must rely on the remedy of specific performance to be enforced and specific performance is a discretionary remedy.'),

Section 13(1)(a) of the 1980 Act provides that a tenant has the right to a new tenancy where he can show that he has been in continuous occupation of the tenement for a period of five years and has used the premises bona fide for business purposes. Temporary breaks in the period of occupation can be overlooked. The Act sets out a wide definition of business use and a business that operates other than for reward will qualify under this section. Section of the 1980 Act applies to a tenant who has been in occupation of the property for any purpose for a continuous period of twenty years. Section of the 1980 Act grants the right to a new tenancy to a tenant who has carried out improvements to the property that account for more than fifty per cent of its current letting value. Even where the tenant is able to establish one of the ''equities'' described above the landlord can resist his claim for a right to a new tenancy if one of the situations described in section 17 pertain: (1) If the tenancy has been terminated for breach of covenant on the part of the tenant or for non-payment of rent then the landlord will be entitled to refuse to grant a new tenancy. Or (2) the landlord will also be entitled to refuse to grant a new tenancy if he wishes to use the property for development or rebuilding or on the basis of good estate management.

Notwithstanding the condition the tenant/defendants had served a notice of intention to claim relief in response to the Plaintiff''s Equity Civil Bill for overholding. Although the tenants had been in occupation of the premises from 1955 to 2004 when the lease expired, Clarke held that the landlord had good and sufficient reason for refusing to renew the lease pursuant to the terms of the 1980 Act. the good and sufficient reasons were that the tenants had failed to keep the premises in good repair and were unable to do so. Once the tenant can show that he has acquired the right then the new tenancy can be granted either by agreement, or where this is not possible the Court will fix the terms of the new tenancy. Where the Court has to fix the terms of the new tenancy it cannot fix the lease for a term of less than five years or for more than thirty-five years. Where the new tenancy has arisen on foot of a business equity then the term should not be more than twenty years. The Court will also fix a new rent, and this must be the rent that a willing tenant not already in possession would be willing to pay and a landlord would be willing to accept on the basis of vacant possession of the property.

They are as follows: Subsection 1: The building is erected by the tenant or his predecessor in title under the lease, either during their tenancy or in anticipation of the tenancy, for example, if the lease contained a covenant to erect buildings. Subsection 2: If the lease is for more than fifty years and the rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property and there is presumption that the buildings were erected by the tenant or his predecessors in title. In Hanlon Limited Sepia Limited, High Court unreported, of January, 1982, Keane delivered an oral judgment that the lessor had to rebut the presumption that the buildings were erected by the tenant or predecessor in title and on hearing evidence given the onus of proof had to be greater than the balance of probability (the civil standard). However, in Barry Registrar of Titles [1992] ILRM 62, MacKenzie reverted to the civil standard rejecting a strict onus of proof, stating that he regarded in civil cases that the Court could do no more than consider a case proved if probably correct and if there were two cases and one is more probable, the more probable succeeds.

This came about in circumstances where it was recognised that many houses in towns in Ireland had been built by lessees who did not hold under a substantial lease or sub-lease, but rather under an oral yearly tenancy, which may always have been oral, or may have arisen on expiry of an earlier lease. In any event, many such tenancies were of significant duration to the extent that it could be said that the tenants had acquired an ''equity'' in the houses that had been built. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 3) Act, 1967 first conferred the right to acquire the fee simple on yearly tenants by themselves or with their predecessors in title. This Act has been substantially amended by the 1978 Act, and later by the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1984 and most recently by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act 2019. Section 15(1)(a) requires that the land is covered wholly or partly by permanent buildings and any land not so covered is subsidiary and ancillary to those buildings. Section requires that the land is held under a contract of yearly tenancy or under a yearly tenancy arising by operation of law or by inference on the expiration of a lease or under a statutory tenancy implied by holding over property on expiration of a lease which reserves a yearly rent. Section requires that the land has been continuously held under any one or more of the tenancies referred to in paragraph (including any expired lease) by the person or his predecessors in title for a period of not less than twenty-five years prior to the date of service by the person of Notice of Intention to Acquire the Fee Simple. Note: The twenty-five-year period of occupation may include any period during which the tenant held under an expired lease. Also, the 1978 Act dropped the requirement that the premises should constitute a ''tenement'' (formerly in the 1967 Act where continuous occupation of the tenant was also required). Therefore, the purchasing tenant is no longer required to be in occupation of the premises at the time of purchase, meaning that any twenty five-year period prior to purchase is sufficient. Section requires that either: the yearly rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property or it is proved that the permanent buildings were erected by the tenant or by his predecessor in title. Section requires that the permanent buildings were not erected by the immediate lessor or any superior lessor or any of their predecessors in title provided, however, that it be presumed until the contrary is proved, that the permanent buildings were not so erected. Note: the 1967 Act required the buildings to have been erected by the occupying tenant or his predecessors with a rebuttable presumption that they were so erected. On the contrary the 1978 Act requires that they were not erected by the lessors or his predecessors with a rebuttable presumption that this is so. Section 15(2) - (5) deal with situations where the yearly tenant would otherwise be excluded because the un-built on portion of the land is not subsidiary and ancillary to the buildings. The land can be treated as two holdings, a built on holding in respect of which the right to acquire the fee simple can be exercised, and a vacant holding in respect of which no such right exists.'),

In relation to physical defects, the caveat emptor principle applies in full. It will also apply to the extent that the vendor is not under a duty to disclose patent defects in the title. Patent defects are those which would be reasonably discoverable by the purchaser from either an inspection of the land or the title documents or which are otherwise obvious from facts brought to his attention. In the case of Flanagan & McGarvey & Thomson''s Contract [1945] 32 the court confirmed that it is well settled that the purchaser of property must take the property subject to any defects which are patent on inspection and are not inconsistent with the description contained in the contract for sale. To be a patent defect the defect must either be visible to the eye or arise by necessary implication from something so visible. In that case the existence of a path leading from the road to the back door of a house indicated as a practical certainty to anyone who saw it that the person who occupied the house would have a right of way over the lands. In relation to the question of persons other than the vendor who may be in occupation of the land, the general principle is that the fact of occupation puts a purchaser on constructive notice of the rights and interests (if any) of the person or persons in occupation. Therefore, where the purchaser is on notice of persons other than the vendor in occupation, he is under a duty of inquiry that supersedes the vendor''s duty to disclose. If both the vendor and purchaser remain silent in relation to the question, then the purchaser takes the land subject to all existing rights. The vendor''s duty of disclosure arises in relation to latent defects in the title that is, those defects which are not obvious to the eye from an inspection of the property. It has been held that the vendor is obliged to disclose only those latent defects of which he is aware or of which he should have been aware. In General Condition 31 the vendor is required to ensure that the purchaser receives notice before the sale of the various matters affecting the property and set out therein. Failure to show that the purchaser received notice or was aware of any of these matters will entitle the purchaser to rescind the contract before completion and claim the return of his deposit under General Condition 33.'),

The Land Registry was established in 1891 and is now operated under the Registration of Title Act, 1964. The Land Registry shows evidence not merely of the existence of a deed in relation to property but as to the nature and extent of the interest dealt with, disposed of or acquired under such a deed. Initial registration in the Land Registry is compulsory where unregistered property is purchased in the state after 1 June 2011 in the following cases, Land bought under the Land Purchase Acts, land acquired after January 1967 by a statutory authority, land sold in Counties Carlow, Meath. Laois from 1 January 1970, land sold in Counties Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon from 1 April 2006, from October 2008, compulsory registration was extended to six additional counties, Clare, Kilkenny, Louth, Sligo, Wexford and Wicklow (S.I. 81 of 2008), with effect from 1 January 2010, compulsory registration was extended to the following additional counties; Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Monaghan, North Tipperary, Offaly, South Tipperary and Waterford and cities Galway, Limerick and Waterford (S.I. 176 of 2009), From 1 June 2011, compulsory registration was extended to the cities and counties of Cork and Dublin (S.I. 516 of 2010). Once title has been registered in the land registry it carries with it a State guarantee as to its validity. The Register is deemed to be conclusive evidence of title and conclusive evidence of any right, privilege, appurtenance or burden appearing on the title (with the exception of certain burdens set out in section 72 of the 1964 Act which are capable of affecting the land without being registered). The register of title in the Land Registry is shown on a Folio that relates to each particular property. Each Folio contains a description of the property, the name of the registered owner and the capacity in which they hold the land and a list of any burdens or charges that affect the land and are capable of registration under section 69. The Land Registry holds File Plans showing the extent of the property registered on the folio. (these File Plans are updated with Ordnance Survey map detail). Each Folio will have a File Plan attached to it showing the boundaries of the property. However, it is important to remember that this is not deemed to be conclusive as to the extent of the lands or the boundaries. Property registered in the Land Registry is disposed of and acquired by means of a deed of transfer. Both freehold and leasehold property can be transferred once it is registered in the Land Registry. Under the provisions of the 1964 Act, the title to registered land only passes on the registration of a deed of transfer and not at the date of its execution. Therefore, once a property has been registered in the Land Registry, every subsequent disposal of an interest in the property must be registered on the folio opened in respect of the particular property in question. The date upon which an application for registration is lodged will be the date of registration. Most of the documents lodged in the Land Registry in relation to any disposition of property will be retained by the Land Registry when the application has been completed and the folio will be updated to reflect the new position. Therefore, in general the only title document required in respect of a registered property will be a certified copy of the folio. This means that conveyancing procedures will usually be less complex and more efficient in relation to registered property, compared to property that is unregistered. In order to show that he is entitled to occupy land or that he is entitled to dispose of land, a person must be able to show that he has a good title to that land.'),

The exception to this is where the folio shows that the registered owner has merely a possessory title (or a title subject to equities on older folios). What this means is that the person is registered as owner subject to interests or rights that may have arisen prior to or at the time of registration. Clearly the purchaser will have to conduct inquiries to ascertain what these rights and interests might be, and the identity of the persons entitled to exercise such rights and interests.

A court will not compel a purchaser to accept a bad or defective title and it is well-established that a vendor must not only have a good title but must be able to present sufficient evidence to make out or show his or her title. It is important for the vendor''s solicitor to investigate title at the outset to establish the quality of the title that his client has to offer and thereafter to determine how the contract for sale should be drafted.

Of course, in some circumstances it may be necessary to offer a much older title for instance where the only available good root is more than twenty years old. In relation to a leasehold title or a title that is based on a fee farm grant, the root of title will always be the original lease or the fee farm grant, no matter how old, as the covenants and conditions contained in these documents will still affect the property.

These are specific performance, an action for damages or rescission. Specific performance is a remedy that is usually peculiar to contracts for the sale of land and is not generally available for other kinds of contract. The injured party seeks an order from the Court compelling the other party to perform the contract specifically. In an action for damages the injured party seeks an award that will compensate him for any loss occasioned by the breach of contract. Rescission is not strictly speaking a judicial remedy. It is a unilateral right where the injured party in certain circumstances can elect to repudiate his obligations under the contract and revert to his pre-contract position as if the contract had never been made. Rescission effectively brings the contract to an end and the contract cannot then be revived except by something amounting to a new agreement between the parties. Rescission can be exercised without requiring an application to the Courts but quite often the party rescinding the contract may seek declaratory relief confirming his right to rescind and perhaps, other consequential relief. In Wynn Clons Development Ltd Cooke [2016] IECA 317 the Court of Appeal, in a judgment given by Hedigan (Peart and Hogan concurring), recognised the principle that remedies like rescission and forfeiture of the deposit and specific performance are alternative. While a vendor may initially claim them all, he must at the very latest elect at the date of the hearing which he wants.

He explained that "in the ordinary way, a party is not entitled as of right to have a decree of specific performance discharged and seek, instead, damages in lieu of specific performance". A party is entitled to pursue both reliefs up to and at the trial of an action concerning a contract for the sale of land and leave it up to the judge to decide as to which alternative remedy is the more appropriate. In that situation, as Clarke explained, there would be no actual order made for specific performance. He continued: However, where a party seeks an order for specific performance and it is granted, then the starting point has to be that that party has elected for specific performance rather than damages. However, it is equally clear that the court has a jurisdiction to discharge an order for specific performance and direct that damages in lieu should be assessed provided that it is, in all the circumstances, equitable so to do. One fundamental difference between specific performance and the common law remedy of damages is that it is not necessary to show a breach of contract before seeking specific performance whereas this will be a precondition to any action for damages. The plaintiff can issue proceedings for specific performance before the date for completion set out in the contract has come, as in the case of Hasham Zenab [1960] 316 where the vendor tore up the contract within minutes of having signed it. A vendor who is seeking specific performance of a contract is under no duty to seek to mitigate his loss by reselling the property when the purchaser refuses to complete since this would require him to take a step that would preclude him from the performance of his obligations under the contract with the purchaser (Ellis Lawrence (1969) Estates Gazette 215). Specific performance is an equitable remedy and like all equitable remedies it is discretionary in nature. This means that the court will have regard to issues such as the conduct of the applicant and whether there has been laches (delay) or acquiescence on the part of the applicant in relation to his claim. However, in reality it would require quite exceptional circumstances before a party would be refused an order for specific performance. However, specific performance will not be ordered if it is no longer possible to compel the completion of the agreement. Equity does nothing in vain and where the vendor has already conveyed the property to a different purchaser, the court will not make any order, except in a situation where the second conveyance was a sham and the vendor has it in his power to compel the second purchaser to convey the lands to the first purchaser (Jones Lipman [1962] 1 All 442). Before specific performance can be granted the applicant must show two things. Firstly, he must prove the existence of a concluded contract between the parties whose terms are sufficiently certain to enable the court to order their performance. So, where the parties had not reached agreement in relation to the contract, specific performance will not be available. It is clearly not an appropriate remedy to be deployed at the pre-contract stage when the parties are merely in negotiation. Secondly, the applicant must himself be able and willing to perform his obligations under the contract. Therefore, where a vendor serves a notice making time of the essence in the contract he will not then be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he is unable to complete on the specified date. Similarly, equity will not assist a vendor who cannot show a good title.'),

However, it may be the case that a less serious mistake, while not enough to render the contract void or to give grounds for rescission in equity, may nonetheless be sufficient to prevent a court from making a decree of specific performance. In the case of Webster Cecil (1861) 30 Beav 62 the vendor offered a property for sale at the wrong price (£1,250 instead of £2,250 as he had intended). The purchaser accepted the offer even though he was aware of the mistake. Romilly held that since the vendor had given immediate notice of the mistake, he would not be compelled to sell the property at an under value and the purchaser''s action for specific performance failed. By contrast in the case of Tamplin James (1880) 15 215 the plaintiff offered land and a public house for sale by reference to the area. The defendant did not look at the plans and assumed in error that a plot of land behind the pub was included in the sale. There was no misdescription or ambiguity in the particulars of sale. When the defendant realised his error, he refused to complete the contract. However, the court ordered specific performance of the sale. James stated that "for the most part the cases where a defendant has escaped on the grounds of a mistake not contributed to by the plaintiff have been cases where a hardship amounting to an injustice would have been inflicted upon him by holding him to his bargain and it was unreasonable to hold him to it . . . If a man makes a mistake of this kind without any reasonable excuse he ought to be held to his bargain".'),

However, it transpired that the purchaser had already made a number of under-the-counter payments in respect of the property. McWilliam said that the contract was intrinsically illegal as it involved an attempt to defraud the Revenue Commissioners and he refused relief on the basis of the maxim that ''he who comes to equity must come with clean hands''. He stated that he was not entitled to countenance attempts to defraud the Revenue by enforcing the performance of this contract at the instance of one party or another. In Kavanagh Caulfield [2002] IEHC 67 Roderick Murphy held that where illegality is alleged by the defendant the court must consider the quality of such illegality and examine all the surrounding circumstances.

In Neville and Sons Ltd. Guardian Builders Ltd. [1995] 1 ILRM 1 the plaintiff agreed to build houses on a site owned by the defendant. To enable this to happen it was necessary for the defendant to acquire a strip of roadway from the local authority so as to allow access to the site. When this acquisition ran into difficulties the plaintiff sought specific performance of the contract. The defendant raised impossibility as a defence contending that the contract could no longer be performed in the manner that had been envisaged. However, the Supreme Court held that this defence could not succeed in the circumstances and that the contract had not been frustrated but had merely become more onerous. Blayney stated that frustration of a contract takes place where there is a supervening event (without default of either party and for which the contract makes no provision) and which so significantly changes the nature (and not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution that it would be unreasonable to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations in the new circumstances. A defendant cannot rely on the doctrine of frustration or impossibility where the supervening event is one he anticipated or should have anticipated at the outset of the contract. McGuill Aer Lingus Teo (unreported October 3 1983). In Aranbel Limited Seamus McGivern and Audrey McGivern; Aranbel Limited Richard D''arcy and Marcy D''arcy [2010] IEHC 272 (Clarke July 9, 2010) the Plaintiff, as vendor, and the defendants, as purchasers, entered into contract for sale of separate apartments at Fortunes Lawn, Citywest in the County of Dublin, estimated to be completed within approximately one year. The Plaintiff instituted proceedings in October 2008 seeking specific performance of the contracts and the matter came before the courts on foot of a motion for judgment in default of defence. The defendants admitted that they were in breach of a binding contract, however; argued that as they were no longer in a financial position to complete the sale, the courts should order that damages be assessed in lieu of specific performance. The court awarded damages in lieu of specific performance. Clarke held that specific performance was an equitable remedy and a court should be reluctant to make such an order where there is no reasonable prospect of the order being complied with. The making of such an order simply leads to a further hearing at which the order is discharged and damages in lieu directed. The judge stated that, in certain circumstances, there may be a legal impossibility of completion, for instance, where the vendor cannot show title. If it can be shown that the vendor can cure their title problem, however, a court will grant specific performance. (Mount Kennett Investment Ltd. O''Mara [2007] IEHC 420). In the instant case, the impossibility was due to the impecuniosity of the defendants and impossibility must be distinguished from hardship. In order to show that completion is impossible, a purchaser must show that they have no realisable assets or borrowing capacity to meet the purchase price. Where this is shown, a court should not make an order for specific performance. It was argued that specific performance should be refused due to the delay on the part of the plaintiff in instituting the proceedings. Generally, a plaintiff who delays unreasonably in bringing proceedings may fail to obtain specific performance where it would now be inequitable to grant the relief. Despite this, damages still remain open to the plaintiff, even where specific performance has been refused. (Lark Developments Ltd. Dublin Corporation, unreported, High Court, Murphy'),

In Frawley Neill (unreported March 1 1999) Aldous suggested that delay could not be measured against a preconceived formula but the court when considering delay should take a broad approach and consider whether in all the circumstances it would be unconscionable to allow the plaintiff who has been guilty of delay to succeed.

Laffoy held that the trial judge did not have jurisdiction to award damages in lieu of specific performance. As regards the argument advanced on behalf of Plaintiff, that they are entitled to damages at common law for breach of contract, Laffoy held that as no such claim was made or pleaded in the High Court or considered by the trial judge, they cannot pursue such a claim on the appeal. Laffoy went on to make it clear that this ruling did not exclude an action for damages at common law, though in this case it was likely to be statute-barred.'),

However, there is an exception to this principle where the title is obviously bad and acceptance of it will expose the purchaser to immediate eviction from the premises. This is because the essence of the remedy is that the purchaser should get the land and therefore it is not capable of being granted in any situation in which the purchaser cannot get the land in any substantial sense. A title will be considered doubtful where it depends upon the construction of a will or of some badly drafted document or upon a set of facts that it is difficult to confirm or establish. The court will not compel a purchaser by specific performance to accept a doubtful title. However, the court may try to resolve the alleged doubt if it can be resolved by determining questions of law. However, a purchaser will not be permitted to raise a doubt as to the vendor''s title where the alleged doubt relates to a matter that he is precluded from objecting to under the special conditions of the contract (Wilson Thomas [1958] 1 All 871). In any proceedings for specific performance the purchaser can request the court to conduct an inquiry into the vendor''s title to establish whether the vendor is offering a good title or not. A vendor may establish a prima facie case for specific performance but where it transpires that his title is not good, the court will not compel the purchaser to accept it. Failure to comply with an order for specific performance is a contempt of court and a person who fails to comply with such an order is liable to attachment and committal.

The latter value is the price readily obtainable on a resale within a reasonable time of the breach. In assessing damages, the vendor must give credit for any deposit that has been paid to him. In reality where the quantum of the loss is covered and most likely exceeded by the amount of the deposit, the vendor will be satisfied to simply forfeit the deposit and rescind the contract. In Hooper Oates [2013] EWCA Civ 91, the English Court of Appeal took the view that, in assessing damages to be paid to a vendor by a purchaser who has failed to complete a contract for the sale of land, the appropriate date for valuation of the land will rarely be the date of the breach. This is because valuation to some extent depends on availability of a market and a period of marketing before valuation should be assumed. In some cases, the eventual resale price achieved by the vendor may be the appropriate valuation, provided the vendor had not failed to mitigate his loss by delaying too long or not following professional advice. If the vendor eventually decides not to resell, the date of this decision may be the appropriate date. In any event the purchaser could not complain about a fall in market values in the interim. Even if he had completed at the contract price, he would still suffer any fall in value which occurred subsequently without any right of recourse against the vendor.'),

A resale of the property at an increased purchase price would be accepted as prima facie evidence of its market value. Where the property was purchased for development purposes the purchaser may be able to claim damages for the loss of prospective profits if such damages are as may reasonably have been supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach (following the rule in Hadley Baxendale (1854)'),

Firstly, he must prove the existence of a concluded contract between the parties whose terms are sufficiently certain to enable the court to order their performance."}'::jsonb, ARRAY['AI', 'Land & Conveyancing'], 'The remedy of specific performance arises out of the principle promoted by equity that where damages at common law would be inadequate to compensate a frustrated party, such a person should have that which he has contracted for. For this reason, specific performance will not be granted where the plaintiff has an adequate remedy in damages. It is a remedy that is reserved for a situation where it is possible to provide a more perfect and complete form of justice than can be provided by an award of damages. This is consistent with the position of the purchaser who will bring a specific performance action compelling the vendor to convey the land to him, but the vendor will also be entitled to the remedy notwithstanding that his claim is essentially monetary in nature (Adderly Dixon (1824) 1 Sim & 607). In practice of course a vendor is usually content to forfeit the deposit and re-sell the property and specific performance will be of little use to him where the purchaser does not have sufficient funds to pay for the purchase of the property. In Mount Kennett Investment Company O''Meara [2011] IEHC 210, Clarke laid down some important principles in relation to the awarding of damages in lieu of specific performance. He explained that "in the ordinary way, a party is not entitled as of right to have a decree of specific performance discharged and seek, instead, damages in lieu of specific performance". A party is entitled to pursue both reliefs up to and at the trial of an action concerning a contract for the sale of land and leave it up to the judge to decide as to which alternative remedy is the more appropriate. In that situation, as Clarke explained, there would be no actual order made for specific performance. He continued: However, where a party seeks an order for specific performance and it is granted, then the starting point has to be that that party has elected for specific performance rather than damages. However, it is equally clear that the court has a jurisdiction to discharge an order for specific performance and direct that damages in lieu should be assessed provided that it is, in all the circumstances, equitable so to do. One fundamental difference between specific performance and the common law remedy of damages is that it is not necessary to show a breach of contract before seeking specific performance whereas this will be a precondition to any action for damages. The plaintiff can issue proceedings for specific performance before the date for completion set out in the contract has come, as in the case of Hasham Zenab [1960] 316 where the vendor tore up the contract within minutes of having signed it. A vendor who is seeking specific performance of a contract is under no duty to seek to mitigate his loss by reselling the property when the purchaser refuses to complete since this would require him to take a step that would preclude him from the performance of his obligations under the contract with the purchaser (Ellis Lawrence (1969) Estates Gazette 215). Specific performance is an equitable remedy and like all equitable remedies it is discretionary in nature. This means that the court will have regard to issues such as the conduct of the applicant and whether there has been laches (delay) or acquiescence on the part of the applicant in relation to his claim. However, in reality it would require quite exceptional circumstances before a party would be refused an order for specific performance. However, specific performance will not be ordered if it is no longer possible to compel the completion of the agreement. Equity does nothing in vain and where the vendor has already conveyed the property to a different purchaser, the court will not make any order, except in a situation where the second conveyance was a sham and the vendor has it in his power to compel the second purchaser to convey the lands to the first purchaser (Jones Lipman [1962] 1 All 442). Before specific performance can be granted the applicant must show two things. Firstly, he must prove the existence of a concluded contract between the parties whose terms are sufficiently certain to enable the court to order their performance. So, where the parties had not reached agreement in relation to the contract, specific performance will not be available. It is clearly not an appropriate remedy to be deployed at the pre-contract stage when the parties are merely in negotiation. Secondly, the applicant must himself be able and willing to perform his obligations under the contract. Therefore, where a vendor serves a notice making time of the essence in the contract he will not then be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he is unable to complete on the specified date. Similarly, equity will not assist a vendor who cannot show a good title.'),

However, it may be the case that a less serious mistake, while not enough to render the contract void or to give grounds for rescission in equity, may nonetheless be sufficient to prevent a court from making a decree of specific performance. In the case of Webster Cecil (1861) 30 Beav 62 the vendor offered a property for sale at the wrong price (£1,250 instead of £2,250 as he had intended). The purchaser accepted the offer even though he was aware of the mistake. Romilly held that since the vendor had given immediate notice of the mistake, he would not be compelled to sell the property at an under value and the purchaser''s action for specific performance failed. By contrast in the case of Tamplin James (1880) 15 215 the plaintiff offered land and a public house for sale by reference to the area. The defendant did not look at the plans and assumed in error that a plot of land behind the pub was included in the sale. There was no misdescription or ambiguity in the particulars of sale. When the defendant realised his error, he refused to complete the contract. However, the court ordered specific performance of the sale. James stated that "for the most part the cases where a defendant has escaped on the grounds of a mistake not contributed to by the plaintiff have been cases where a hardship amounting to an injustice would have been inflicted upon him by holding him to his bargain and it was unreasonable to hold him to it . . . If a man makes a mistake of this kind without any reasonable excuse he ought to be held to his bargain".'),

He is not entitled to recover the purchase price as damages unless the conveyance has been executed and the legal title is vested in the purchaser on the basis that he cannot have both the land and its value. Therefore, he is usually limited to recovering the difference in value (if any) between the contract price and the value of the property at the time of the breach. The latter value is the price readily obtainable on a resale within a reasonable time of the breach. In assessing damages, the vendor must give credit for any deposit that has been paid to him. In reality where the quantum of the loss is covered and most likely exceeded by the amount of the deposit, the vendor will be satisfied to simply forfeit the deposit and rescind the contract. In Hooper Oates [2013] EWCA Civ 91, the English Court of Appeal took the view that, in assessing damages to be paid to a vendor by a purchaser who has failed to complete a contract for the sale of land, the appropriate date for valuation of the land will rarely be the date of the breach. This is because valuation to some extent depends on availability of a market and a period of marketing before valuation should be assumed. In some cases, the eventual resale price achieved by the vendor may be the appropriate valuation, provided the vendor had not failed to mitigate his loss by delaying too long or not following professional advice. If the vendor eventually decides not to resell, the date of this decision may be the appropriate date. In any event the purchaser could not complain about a fall in market values in the interim. Even if he had completed at the contract price, he would still suffer any fall in value which occurred subsequently without any right of recourse against the vendor.'),
