In Ireland, the courts are obliged to have regard to the Personal Injuries Guidelines. See the later chapter on assessment of damages in personal injuries for further details. NOMINAL AND CONTEMPTUOUS DAMAGES Nominal and contemptuous damages can be understood as a species of compensatory damages, although they do not compensate a plaintiff. Nominal damages can be awarded where a plaintiff''s legal right has been infringed but where no actual damage has been sustained. This can arise when a plaintiff sues for a tort which is actionable per Trespass and defamation, for instance, unlike negligence do not require that the plaintiff suffer any damage in order to sue. Sometimes a plaintiff will bring an action purely to vindicate a legal right. In such circumstances, an award of nominal damages does not constitute an adverse comment on the character of the plaintiff or of the plaintiff''s claim.'),

They are awarded to a plaintiff who has a technically well-grounded case but no real moral claim to damages. They are most often granted in defamation actions. SPECIAL AND GENERAL DAMAGES These terms give rise to some confusion because they are used to mean different things by different people. As a practitioner, you will most frequently come across the terms in the context of personal injuries litigation. In that context, it is customary to refer to readily quantifiable pre-trial damages, such as medical expenses or loss of earnings, as "special damages". Damages for pain and suffering are then referred to as "general damages". The amount sought for general damages is not quantified in pleadings. The terms have at least two other meanings. Sometimes "special damage" is understood to mean damage over and above that which the law presumes to flow from the tort. Special damage of this type must be specifically pleaded; general damage need not be. Special damage is sometimes understood to mean damage which a plaintiff must prove in order to show a good cause of action for a tort that is not actionable per For instance, negligence is not actionable per the plaintiff must prove some form of damage. In torts which are actionable per general damage is presumed.'),

EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND AGGRAVATED DAMAGES EXEMPLARY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES The terms "exemplary damages" and "punitive damages" are used interchangeably. Historically, it was clear that punitive damages could be awarded for particularly grievous infringements of a plaintiff''s rights. Such awards, which were more than merely compensatory (i.e. more than the amount needed to put them in the position they would have been in if the tort had not been committed), were made notwithstanding the fact that compensation came to be seen as the main purpose of torts law. In England and Wales, there is a line of authority, starting with Rookes Barnard [1964] 1129, which tries to reduce the number of situations in which exemplary damages can be awarded to a couple of narrowly defined situations. Despite a number of supportive dicta from a number of Irish judges, Rookes Barnard probably does not represent the law in Ireland. Therefore, there are no a priori limitations on the situations in which exemplary damages are available to a plaintiff. Exemplary damages will be awarded where the court is of the view that there is some element in the defendant''s conduct which requires punishment. For instance, has the defendant''s conduct been particularly oppressive of the plaintiff?'),

Is the defendant an emanation of the State? Have the plaintiff''s constitutional rights been infringed? These are just some of the factors which you should consider when deciding whether to formulate a claim for exemplary damages. It has been held that exemplary damages can be awarded for all of the conduct of the defendant, right up until the end of trial, including the speeches of counsel. Conversely, an apology by the defendant in the witness box might mitigate against the grant of exemplary damages. AGGRAVATED DAMAGES Aggravated damages are best understood as a modification of the concept of compensatory damages which somewhat blurs the distinction with the concept of exemplary damages. Like exemplary damages, aggravated damages turn on the external circumstances connected to the commission of the tort. However, aggravated damages are still measured on a compensatory basis. In a sense, aggravated damages seek to compensate the injured feelings of the plaintiff, where that injury is justifiably increased by the manner in which the tort was committed or the motive of the defendant.'),

This remedy is available only if there is no other remedy in damages available. One may institute proceedings in either the High Court or the Circuit Court; the amount of damages recoverable in the Circuit Court will not exceed the jurisdiction of that Court, whatever that is at the time. Proceedings in this regard cannot be brought more than one year after the cause of action giving rise to the proceedings. Despite the limitations on this right to damages, which make it effectively a reserve remedy where other national law remedies fail, it is worth considering its possibility in circumstances where you might be thinking of exemplary damages. For instance, if your client wishes to sue the Gardaí for false imprisonment, you might also consider an action for damages under Article 5 of the Convention (which provides for the right to liberty and security). The scope of Convention provisions is outside the scope of this course, but you may find that a right of action under the Convention is subject to fewer restrictions than a common law right of action.'),

This requires courts to interpret, insofar as is possible, statutory provisions and rules of law in a manner compatible with the Convention.) DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS In some circumstances, a plaintiff may have a separate action for breach of a constitutional right. The case law on this issue is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the courts have not stated that actions cannot be brought for damages for breach of constitutional rights. On the other hand, the courts have been very slow to allow plaintiffs succeed in any such action but may do so in circumstances where the interest at stake is not adequately protected by some other means. For detailed discussion of this, see McMahon and Binchy, Law of Torts, Bloomsbury Professional, 2013.'),

The most significant restriction in this regard is the doctrine of remoteness. In theory, a chain of causation can run and run, exposing the tortfeasor to ever more liability. The doctrine of remoteness effectively imposes a cut-off point in this chain of causation, beyond which the tortfeasor will not be responsible for the injury or loss caused by his or her tortious actions. The principles of this doctrine of remoteness are more a matter of substantive tort law rather than the law of damages, but the most basic ones will be set out here. THE GENERAL TEST OF REASONABLE FORESEEABILITY A person is always liable for consequences which he or she intends to cause. However, (for most torts) a person is not liable for consequences which he or she did not intend, unless it was reasonably foreseeable that consequences of that type would ensue. The courts are particularly cautious in relation to psychological injury and economic loss and so in considering what is reasonably foreseeable in relation to either of these types of loss you should refer to the textbooks and cases dealing with the substantive tort law on these areas. THE EGG-SHELL SKULL RULE The egg-shell skull rule limits the application of reasonable foreseeability principles with regard to physical and psychological injury.'),
                                                                                                                 ('Section 1: Chapter 1: Damages in Torts Law', 'Foundation Manual', 'Is the egg-shell skull rule applicable to economic losses incurred due to a tortfeasor''s actions?', 'mcq', '{"correct_index":-1,"justification":"The case of Liesbosch Dredger Edison [1933] 448 suggested that the egg-shell skull rule did not apply in such a situation."}'::jsonb, ARRAY['AI', 'Foundation'], 'This rule requires that the tortfeasor take their victim as they find them. Thus, if a tort victim suffers unforeseeable injury as a result of an underlying medical condition - even if the tortfeasor could not have known of that condition - the tortfeasor will still be liable for that injury if it was reasonably foreseeable that the tort victim would suffer some injury. THE EGG-SHELL SKULL RULE AND THE IMPECUNIOUS PLAINTIFF It is unclear whether the egg-shell skull rule applies to economic loss suffered by an impecunious victim. For instance, if a tort victim is impecunious and therefore has to take out a loan to cover expenses occasioned by the tort, should the tortfeasor be liable for the interest that they have to pay on that loan? The case of Liesbosch Dredger Edison [1933] 448 suggested that the egg-shell skull rule did not apply in such a situation. A number of Irish cases have held the tortfeasor liable in similar circumstances, but more based on a finding that the loss was foreseeable rather than a finding that the egg-shell skull rule applied. See, for instance, Rabbette Mayo County Council [1984] ILRM 156. Subsequently in the it was held in the case of Lagden O''Connor [2004] 1 1067 at 1088: "It is not necessary for us to say that The Liesbosch was wrongly decided.'),

The wrongdoer must take his victim as he finds him: ... This rule applies to the economic state of the victim in the same way as it applies to his physical and mental vulnerability.". In Doran & Doran Delaney & Others (No 2) [1999] 1 303 Geoghegan having considered case law on impecuniosity and the assessment of damages stated at Page 316 find as a fact that the plaintiffs in this case acted perfectly reasonably after the débâcle had occurred and that losses flowing from their having to salvage the situation as best they could due to their inability to raise alternative funds to put them back in the position which they would have been in but for breaches of duty and misrepresentation are all reasonably foreseeable losses." TORTS WHICH DO NOT HAVE A REASONABLE FORESEEABILITY TEST It is settled that the reasonable foreseeability test of remoteness applies to the torts of negligence and nuisance. However, in strict torts such as trespass and the rule in Rylands Fletcher, it appears that a different standard applies. McMahon and Binchy suggest that under these torts, a tortfeasor is liable for all the direct consequences of the tort, provided that some damage was foreseeable.'),

If it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, liability is apportioned equally. Section 41 provides that where an action is brought in a court of limited jurisdiction, damages may be awarded up to the limit of that jurisdiction, notwithstanding that such damages have first been reduced under section 34(1).

Whether a plaintiff has taken reasonable steps to mitigate their loss is for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis. See Dorgan, Damages Round Hall 2021 - 4.117-4.163). One difference between contributory negligence and failure to mitigate is that the former occurs before the damage is sustained whereas the latter occurs after the damage is sustained. Section of the Civil Liability Act 1961 provides that a negligent or careless failure to mitigate damage will be deemed to be contributory negligence. However, it is contributory negligence causative not as regards the whole damage suffered but only as regards the amount by which such damage exceeds the damage that would have occurred without the failure to mitigate. If the plaintiff''s failure to mitigate is in some way due to fault on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff''s damages caused by the failure to mitigate will be reduced proportionately rather than precluded altogether. For instance, a plaintiff''s doctor who negligently caused the initial injury might also negligently contribute to a failure to mitigate where she did not identify the problem speedily; a plaintiff might also contribute where they did not take mitigating action even after the problem had been identified.'),

EXAMPLES OF FAILURE TO MITIGATE DAMAGE A refusal to undergo surgical treatment, if unreasonable, can constitute a failure to mitigate damage. See McAuley London Transport Executive [1957] 2 Lloyd''s Rep 500. What is reasonable depends on the plaintiff''s own circumstances. An operation that is reasonable for one plaintiff might be less reasonable for a plaintiff with an underlying medical condition. The courts will obviously be very deferential to the plaintiff''s own medical advice and in a 50:50 situation, to the plaintiff''s own preferences. A refusal of alternative employment may constitute a failure to mitigate if it is unreasonable. In assessing unreasonableness in this context, a court will weigh the anticipated social and financial cost of accepting the alternative employment against the financial reward. Thus a person would not be expected to accept work which they would find unsuitable, for example for family or personal reasons. 3. CONCURRENT WRONGDOERS LIABILITY OF CONCURRENT WRONGDOERS Part III of the Civil Liability Act 1961 regulates the liabilities of concurrent wrongdoers, not just with regard to torts law but generally. Two or more persons are concurrent wrongdoers if they are responsible to a third person for the same damage. Also, where one person is vicariously liable for the wrong of another, the two will be treated as concurrent wrongdoers.'),

The judgment in an action against concurrent wrongdoers who are sued together will take effect as if it were given against them separately. Satisfaction by one concurrent wrongdoer (i.e. payment of the full damages either agreed between the parties or determined by the courts) discharges all other concurrent wrongdoers. THE BASIS FOR CONTRIBUTION BETWEEN CONCURRENT WRONGDOERS Section 21(1) provides for contribution between concurrent wrongdoers; the basis for apportionment of the plaintiff''s damages is the comparative blameworthiness of the defendants. If concurrent wrongdoer A wishes to make a claim from concurrent wrongdoer he or she must make the claim in the same action if is already in the same action. If is not in the same action, A should serve a third party notice on as soon as reasonably possible (see the chapter on Third Parties in the Civil Practice Manual). INDEPENDENT ITEMS OF DAMAGE OF THE SAME KIND Where two persons cause independent items of damage of the same kind the court may apportion liability between such persons in such a manner as may be justified by the probabilities of the case even though such persons are not concurrent wrongdoers.

There are also different types of non-pecuniary losses: past and future pain and suffering; past and future loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation of life. SPECIAL AND GENERAL DAMAGES Special damages represent the plaintiff''s actual pecuniary loss between the date of the injury and the date of trial. These can be quantified precisely and must be specifically pleaded. General damages are more difficult to quantify and comprise future pecuniary loss as well as past and future non-pecuniary loss. Unlike special damages, general damages are not costed individually in the pleadings (see further the chapters on drafting pleadings in the Civil Manual). RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PECUNIARY AND NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES In O''Leary O''Connell [1968] 149, the Supreme Court held that it was best practice to award damages separately under various heads of damages.

This decision, although much criticised, has been endorsed by the courts on a number of occasions and appears to represent the law. A very recent judgment of the Court of Appeal deals with the Reddy Bates deduction for future loss of earnings with Noonan setting out certain considerations to be taken into account - see Twomey Jeral Limited & Ors [2022] IECA 177. A ONCE AND FOR ALL AWARD In the vast majority of civil cases that come before the Irish courts if an award of damages is made, it is a once and for all award. This means that the amount of damages will depend on a number of probabilities. For example, if the plaintiff has a life expectancy of 40, the damages will be assessed on that basis. Once the award is agreed or determined it cannot be revisited, regardless of whether the plaintiff dies before or after the age of 40. In catastrophic injury cases, The Civil Liability Act 1961 as amended now allows for periodic payment orders in cases involving catastrophic injury.'),

For instance, in Chaplin Hicks [1911] 2 786 (a contract case), the plaintiff was compensated for her lost chance of successfully competing for a prize in a beauty competition.

In order to make this assessment, a court needs access to certain facts. With regard to pre-trial loss of earnings, the plaintiff must be able to prove facts about, inter alia, his or her inability to work and what work was available.

RULES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF LOSS OF EARNINGS The rules for the assessment of loss of earnings capacity are complicated. In particular, one needs to be able to calculate the plaintiff''s net pay and to ascertain which compensatory payments are deductible from any award of damages. * A plaintiff is entitled to damages for past losses of earnings. These should be pleaded as special damages. * A plaintiff is entitled to damages for future losses of earnings. The Court should be provided with enough evidence to calculate a capital sum which will compensate the plaintiff. Guidelines for calculating loss of earnings: (a) The following need to be established: - The multiplicand: this is a weekly or annual figure for the plaintiff''s loss of earnings, which can then be multiplied by the duration of the loss; - The duration of the loss; - Possibilities of adverse contingencies affecting the plaintiff''s earning capacity, for instance strikes or ill health; - The appropriate discount rate - this is because the plaintiff is receiving a sum now for future losses. The plaintiff does not need the entire sum now and could invest it. The discount rate seeks to take account of that possibility for investment so as to avoid overcompensation. It also takes account of projected inflation rates.'),

In calculating the multiplicand, the Court must have regard to a number of sources of income: - Wages or salary from principal employment, net of income tax, PRSI and other state levies and net of expenses which the plaintiff would have incurred in making these earnings. (Note that if awards of damages were themselves to become taxable, this rule might change or be modified.); - Fringe benefits; - Income from secondary employment. If the plaintiff is completely incapacitated, this total sum will constitute the multiplicand. It is complete and does not need to be reduced in any way. If the plaintiff is partially incapacitated and can receive earnings from some less remunerative work, the total sum less the earnings from that work will constitute the multiplicand. The multiplicand can, however, be increased by a number of factors: - The likelihood of increases in real earnings; - The likelihood of promotion and seniority; - The likelihood of more remunerative employment. The multiplicand can be reduced by a number of factors: - Sick pay, where the employer is under an obligation to pay the sick pay and the plaintiff is under no obligation to pay it back; - Adverse contingencies, other than death (death being a contingency that goes to duration of loss). These points have so far assumed that the plaintiff is an employed person.'),

This is done to avoid injustice to the plaintiff''s dependants. The plaintiff''s own living expenses should be deducted from this sum, as well as the other deductions dealt with above. There is a general statutory rule that compensating payments are not deductible from the award for damages - see section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 1964 as amended and section 50 of the Civil Liability Act 1961.

The mixed approach sees some objective value to pain and suffering, but also takes into account the effect which the pain and suffering has on the particular plaintiff.

The courts will not shirk from this task; nevertheless, as noted above, if the expectation interest is incalculable, the courts may instead compensate for the reliance interest. REMOTENESS Similar to the reasonable foreseeability test in tort law, contract law imposes a limit in the chain of consequences beyond which a defendant cannot be held liable. The test is laid down in Hadley Baxendale (1854) 9 341, 156 145 which identifies three types of loss for which a defendant will be liable. If a plaintiff''s loss does not fall within one of these categories, it is too remote and the defendant is not liable. The categories are as follows: Damages such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract; Damages such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it; Damages ordinarily arising from special circumstances communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants.

The onus of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the damages sought fall within one of the three categories. The Irish courts have suggested that the actual differences between reasonable foreseeability (the remoteness standard in tort law) and reasonable contemplation may not be so great in practice. THE FIRST LIMB OF HADLEY Two cases illustrate the first limb in Hadley Baxendale. In McGrath Kiely [1965] 497, a doctor omitted to mention a particular injury in a medical report prepared for litigation. It was held that a natural consequence of this was that the plaintiff would receive a lower award than that to which they would otherwise have been entitled. As such, the damage was not too remote. In Maye Merriman (unreported, High Court, 13 February 1980), the defendant delayed fulfilling his contractual obligation to sell land to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had intended to stock his land with cattle, the price of which increased during the delay. It was held that this loss did not arise in the usual course of things as the price of cattle could just as easily have fallen in that period.'),

The plaintiffs were launderers and dyers. They contracted with the defendant to supply a new boiler. The boiler was delivered five months late. The defendants were aware of the character of the plaintiffs'' business and had been informed by letter of the use to which it was intended to put the boiler. It was held that the defendants must have known that the plaintiffs would use the boiler in their business; that was the obvious purpose of the boiler. For this reason, the defendants were liable for the loss of profits in those five months. This illustrates the second limb of Hadley. However, as the defendants did not know of a number of particularly lucrative contracts which the plaintiffs could have obtained, they could not be held liable in damages for the loss of those contracts. This illustrates the third limb of Hadley. Parsons Ltd Uttley Ingham [1978] 1 All 525 establishes that, once damage of a particular type is envisaged, the defendant is liable notwithstanding that the extent of the damage was not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.

The rationale for the presumption in favour of granting the order in these circumstances is that land is unique: the plaintiff will not be adequately compensated by an award of damages. CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY OR TO PAY MONEY The opposite presumption applies here. Specific performance will not be granted because usually damages would be an adequate remedy. However, some goods are so rare that damages would not be an adequate remedy; an order of specific performance might be granted in such a case. Generally, damages are an adequate remedy in the case of a contract to pay money. However, specific performance may be ordered where the contract is for the payment of a periodic amount or for the payment of a sum to a third party.

The courts have been slow to grant specific performance in this circumstance. However, there may be greater willingness to enforce such obligations in Ireland than in England.'),

DEFENCE TO AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE Clearly there are doctrines of contract law, such as mistake, which preclude the existence of an enforceable contract. There are also doctrines which do not impugn the underlying contract, but which nevertheless suggest circumstances in which damages would be a more appropriate remedy than specific performance: The courts will generally not grant specific performance in favour of one party where such an order could not be granted in favour of the other party.

LACHES, DELAY, ILLEGALITY AND IMPOSSIBILITY The general equitable principles of laches and delay provide defences to an order for specific performance.

Therefore, it is not necessary to have an antecedent concluded agreement in order to obtain rectification, although such an agreement would be the best evidence of the common continuing intention. The onus lies on the party seeking rectification to show that the written instrument does not reflect the agreement between the parties. Evidence of oral statements of the parties is admissible. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities but, given that one is effectively trying to set aside written evidence of the parties'' intentions, the evidence must be convincing.

The most correct use of the term connotes an equitable remedy by which the courts treat a contract as never validly having come into existence (rescission initio). For instance, a factor such as mistake or misrepresentation (see Chapter 9 below) could lead a court to rescind a contract. The term is often, but in a conceptually unhelpful way, used to apply to the situation where the promisee discharges (or terminates) the contract upon a fundamental breach by the promisor. Treitel notes "while the courts .... may sometimes continue to use the word "rescission" [in such instances], "termination" is preferred... so as to distinguish clearly the remedy available specifically for breach". Whereas equitable rescission is a backwards-looking remedy which puts the promisee in the position in which he or she would have been in, had the contract not been performed, discharge (or termination) is a forward-looking remedy whereby the promisee treats the contract as being at an end and thus relieves himself or herself of further obligations pursuant to the contract. However, the promisee remains entitled to damages for loss arising out of breaches (including anticipatory breaches) which occurred before the discharge/termination of the contract.

Note that the use of the same term "rescission" in all these contexts has attracted some negative comment from the courts. Use of the same term runs the risk of conflating a number of discrete remedies. You should therefore distinguish between "rescission" and "discharge" but be aware that others may not. Further, the terminology concerning repudiation (fundamental breach) is particularly contentious. Before advising any client on this area, you should consult specialist textbooks on contract law and equity, as well as the primary material. DISCHARGE (TERMINATION) UPON REPUDIATION This is a common law right. A repudiatory breach occurs where one party acts in a way that demonstrates an intention to abandon the contract. The test is whether the breach goes to the root of the contract. Did the breach effectively deprive one party of substantially all the benefit which he or she was due to receive under the contract? A refusal to allow one party perform his or her contractual obligations constitutes a repudiatory breach by the other party. If a term can be classified as a condition of a contract, rather than a warranty, its breach constitutes repudiation of the contract. What constitutes a condition or warranty turns on the interpretation of the contract. Essentially, a condition is considered to be a fundamentally important term whereas a warranty is a less important term.'),

A fundamental breach of an innominate term also amounts to repudiation. An innominate term is one which can be classified neither as a condition nor as a warranty. A fundamental breach is one which deprives the injured party of that for which he or she contracted. It has been suggested that the courts classify breaches more with an eye to the effect of the classification than to the character of the breach itself. Thus, if a court thinks that a plaintiff should be entitled to discharge the contract that court is likely to conclude that the breach amounted to a repudiation. Upon repudiation, the innocent party may choose to discharge/terminate the contract. Alternatively, the innocent party may affirm the contract and confine himself or herself to an action in damages for breach, as well as an action for specific performance. If the innocent party discharges the contract, he or she may only receive damages for breaches of obligations (including anticipatory breaches) which occurred before the discharge/termination. If the innocent party affirms the contract, he or she may also receive damages for breaches which occur into the future, as the contract is still in being.

Treitel noted the following points. The innocent party may have made a bad bargain or their loss might be too remote and so not recoverable as damages. Discharge may also resolve the situation more quickly. For instance, if a seller repudiates and an innocent party discharges before having paid for the goods, the innocent party does not have to take an action for damages. Even if the innocent party has already paid, an action for a liquidated sum avoids the problems of quantification, mitigation and causation which arise in an action for damages. However, the nonperforming party may have strong interests in avoiding discharge/termination. He or she may have incurred expenses in the course of performance; these expenses would be wasted if the contract were discharged. He or she may have conferred benefits on the injured party who would thus be unjustly enriched by discharge. Also, he or she may suffer hardship if an injured party is allowed to discharge on a falling market. DISCHARGE/TERMINATION PURSUANT TO CONTRACT This is a matter of contractual interpretation. RESCISSION IN EQUITY Contracts may be rescinded for mistake, misrepresentation, undue influence and unconscionable transactions.

For instance, a plaintiff in a personal injuries case might have an initial prognosis for a good recovery but then fail to recover. In such circumstances, what looked like a Circuit Court action might turn out to be a High Court action. Conversely, a plaintiff might recover from her injury more fully than was originally expected.

Two dynamics effectively govern such applications. First, a defendant will always prefer to have the action heard in a lower court. So, if the plaintiff seeks to have a matter remitted to a lower court, the defendant will almost invariably consent. Secondly, because of the costs provisions outlined above, the plaintiff bears the risk of proceeding in a court of higher jurisdiction.

However, things are not always so simple. Suppose an Argentine on holiday in Ireland is run down by a Spaniard driving a German-built car, the brakes of which were faulty. Where should the victim sue? What law should the court apply? If the victim sues in Ireland and is successful, how can he or she enforce her judgment against the Spanish driver and the German car manufacturers? Private international law, also referred to as conflicts of law, provides answers to these questions. It resolves the conflict between laws of different countries. This is a hugely complex subject. Yet with increasing internationalisation, it is a subject which is of ever increasing relevance for legal practitioners. The purpose of this chapter is to give a brief overview of the most important principles of the subject and to outline the legislation which, to a certain extent, is replacing the old common law. PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW IS A NATIONAL LAW SUBJECT Contrary to what its name might suggest, private international law is a matter of national law. That is, each state has confronted the sort of situations outlined in the first paragraph above and has attempted to evolve rules which are both practicable and fair.

This is because several conventions, to which all members of the and EEA are signatories, have stipulated common rules for resolving the conflict of laws. These conventions are enacted by legislation in the legal systems of the contracting states and support the important objective of minimising the conflict between different conflict of laws rules. More recently, the European Union has adopted a number of Regulations, largely re-enacting the principles previously contained in the several conventions. OBJECTIVES OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW Private international law can be seen as fulfilling three objectives: * To establish the conditions under which a court is competent to hear a claim (jurisdiction); * To establish for each type of case the particular system of national law which should apply to that case (choice of law); * To establish the circumstances in which a foreign judgment is deemed decisive of a question in dispute and the circumstances in which the right vested in a judgment creditor by a foreign judgment can be enforced by an action in Ireland (enforcement of judgment). It is important to remember that these are three discrete issues. Thus, it is quite possible that an Irish court could consider itself to have jurisdiction to hear a case yet consider itself obliged to apply the law of a different country to that case. Choice of law does not necessarily follow from choice of jurisdiction.'),

These laws were largely superseded by certain legislation, the most recent being the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act 1998, which gave effect to certain international Conventions in Irish law e.g. the Brussels Convention and the Lugano Convention. These Conventions identified the circumstances in which a person domiciled in a contracting state could be sued before the courts of another contracting state. The Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 1968 concerns civil and commercial matters as between contracting states. The Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (Amendment) Act 2012 - gives effect in Irish law to the 2007 Lugano Convention. Non-EU EFTA (European Free Trade Area) Member States (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland), as well as Member States, contract to this latter convention. The provisions of the Lugano Convention are almost, but not entirely, the same as the provisions of the Brussels Convention.

Although some laws are clearly procedural and some are clearly substantive, others are more difficult to classify. Consider the requirement in the Statute of Frauds that certain contracts be evidenced in writing in order to be enforceable. In Leroux Brown (1852) 12 801 the English courts held this to be a procedural rule, thereby depriving the French plaintiff of the benefits of a French contract which would have been enforceable under the law governing the contract.

Secondly, if there is no such clear choice on the part of the parties, the court should identify the law which should govern the contract having regard to the circumstances of the case. As with all common law rules, these are not as straightforward as they might initially appear; you should refer yourself to the specialist textbooks if you need to advise on a particular situation.'),

Originally the subject of common law rules, this area was then governed by the Brussels Convention, rendering the situation somewhat clearer, at least as regards the Member States contracting to that convention. This has now been superseded by Regulation - see Regulation 1215/2012. REGULATION 1215/2012 RECOGNITION DISTINGUISHED FROM ENFORCEMENT It should be noted that recognition is different to enforcement in that a court could recognise a judgment given in another state without enforcing it. For instance, a judgment of a foreign court might become relevant in the course of proceedings in an Irish court. In this context, Articles 36-38 of Regulation 1215/2012 (previously Articles 33-37 of Regulation 44/2001) deal with the recognition of foreign judgments. On the other hand, a person who has received judgment against a defendant in a foreign court, and who wishes to enforce that judgment against assets of the defendant present in Ireland, would seek both recognition and enforcement. THE RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS The clear aim of the Regulation is to make the recognition and enforcement of judgments easier as between the Member States. Article 36 of Regulation 1215/2012 provides that a judgment given in one Member State will be recognised in another Member States without any special procedure having to be followed.'),

Article 45 of Regulation 1215/2012 sets out a number of limited exceptions to the recognition of judgments. It is worth noting these as they also apply to the enforcement of judgments (see below).'),

The sections deal with insurance contracts, consumer contracts with the addition of individual contracts of employment under 1215/2012, and the instances of exclusive jurisdiction listed in Article 22 already considered above. Similarly, Article 45 of 1215/2012 provides that recognition and enforcement will not follow in a case governed by a convention adopted with a third party state under Article 72. However, in examining these grounds of jurisdiction of the foreign court, the recognising court is bound by the findings of fact on which the court of the foreign state based its jurisdiction. ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS Regulation 1215/2012 provides that a judgment given in a Member State which is enforceable in that Member State shall be enforceable in the other Member States without any declaration of enforceability being required. Articles 39-51 of 1215/2012 deal with the enforcement of judgments. The party seeking enforcement shall provide the competent enforcement authority with: (a) a copy of the judgment which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity; and the certificate issued pursuant to Article 53, certifying that the judgment is enforceable and containing an extract of the judgment as well as, where appropriate, relevant information on the recoverable costs of the proceedings and the calculation of interest.'),

THE TRADITIONAL RULES Outside the geographical and subject-matter context of the Regulations and Conventions, the traditional rules still apply.

EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION CLAUSES AND ''TORPEDO'' ACTIONS One of the most controversial aspects of the Brussels Regulation had been the strict interpretation of its lis pendens rules as adopted by the CJEU in Erich Gasser GmbH -vMISAT Srl. Case The case established that where proceedings are brought first in one Member State, all other Member State courts must stay any proceedings involving the same parties and same cause of action pending the first seized court''s decision on jurisdiction. This is so even when those proceedings have been brought in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of another Member State court and irrespective of the amount of time that the jurisdictional issues will take to resolve (in this respect, some courts take much longer than others). This ruling encouraged ''torpedo'' actions whereby proceedings are (wrongly) commenced in one Member State court to delay any proceedings in the chosen court. An example of the tactical use of a torpedo action occurred in the Morgan Europe Ltd Primacom [2005] EWHC 508. Cooke observed that: ...'),

The Mainz proceedings were, after some considerable delay, served on all the [banks] but the Frankfurt proceedings have not yet been served on a number of the [banks]. It is clear that delay is advantageous to Primacom and this appears to be one of its objectives. The judge went on to state that it was ..difficult to see how the German Courts could find that they are entitled to exercise jurisdiction in the face of the exclusive jurisdiction clause" in the facility agreement (para [34]), but concluded that he was still obliged to stay proceedings in England pending a decision by the German courts because the German courts had been seised of the dispute first. The German courts eventually agreed with the English judge''s analysis that they had no jurisdiction to hear the dispute, but only after much expense and delay. The recast Brussels Regulation (Regulation addresses this problem. There is an exception to the previously absolute rule that any court other than the first seised must stay its proceedings pending a decision by the court first seised.'),

All other courts must halt their proceedings once the designated court has established that it has jurisdiction (article 31(3)) or possibly as soon as the chosen court is seised (recital (22)). ABOLITION OF THE EXEQUATUR Exequatur is the procedure for the declaration of enforceability of a judgement given in another member state. In general this has been implemented in Regulation 1215/2012 and the requirement for a declaration of enforceability has been removed. Regulation 1215/2012 provides that a judgment given in another member state which is enforceable in that member state shall be enforceable in the other member states without a declaration of enforceability being required, upon production of a copy of the judgment which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity and a certificate to be issued by the court of origin. The regulation does provide for certain grounds where a court may refuse to recognise and/or enforce a judgment. (Article 45 and 46).

At present, the Convention is only binding on member states (Denmark with certain exceptions), Mexico, Singapore and Montenegro.

However, Article 2 also states that such proceedings are not excluded from the scope of this Convention where such a matter arises merely as a preliminary question and not as an object of the proceedings. In particular, the mere fact that a matter excluded arises by way of defence does not exclude proceedings from the Convention, if that matter is not an object of the proceedings.
