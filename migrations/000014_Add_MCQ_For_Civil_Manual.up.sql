PERIODIC PAYMENT ORDER (PPO) The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 makes provision for an award of damages by way of a periodic payments order in certain circumstances where a plaintiff has suffered catastrophic injuries. "Catastrophic injury" is defined in the Act as: "...in relation to a person, a personal injury which is of such severity that it results in a permanent disability to the person requiring the person to receive life-long care and assistance in all activities of daily living or a substantial part thereof;.." The relevant provisions are contained within Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the 2017 Act and they came into operation on October 2018. The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023 (Part 3) amends the Civil Liability Act 1961 to provide for the setting of the indexation rate for periodic payment orders by Ministerial regulations. This allows the amount of a periodic payment order to be adjusted annually by reference to an index for different goods and services, in order to reflect the rate of inflation, including wage inflation, in Ireland.'),

McCracken held: the respondent never considered himself to be living together with the applicant in a marriage and, certainly in the last four years, ... the applicant did not consider herself to be living together with the respondent in that same sense. It is clear from the provisions that all children of the parties must be taken into consideration, not just children of the marriage. This is particularly important when determining the ancillary reliefs obtainable under Part III of the Act. The Court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation. Solicitors are obliged under sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act to discuss with their clients the prospect of reconciliation, advise on mediation and alternatives to divorce proceedings.

A separation agreement is a contract between the parties to live separate and apart and to regulate their legal rights. Parties may enter into mediation for the purpose of assisting them in agreeing its terms. The separation agreement is subject to the law of contract and practitioners should ensure that each party receives independent legal advice prior to executing the agreement as it is voidable in instances of duress, undue influence and fraud. Although parties may in the alternative elect to regulate their affairs by obtaining a decree of judicial separation or divorce, where they fulfill the criteria set out in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, parties who do not come within these criteria, but whose relationship is acrimonious, may have no alternative but to enter into a separation agreement.

Thus, for example, an Irish person who obtains a Safety Order in the Irish Courts under the Domestic Violence Act 2018 may invoke that Safety Order directly in another Member States by presenting a certificate to the competent authorities. AN OVERVIEW OF THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION On the November 2015, Ireland signed the Istanbul Convention. The Istanbul Convention is broad in scope in so far as its purpose is to prevent and/or eliminate all violence, including domestic violence, which affects women disproportionately. The main aspects of the Convention are set out later in this chapter. It took in excess of three years but as of the of March, 2019, Ireland ratified the Istanbul Convention.'),

Section 2 of the Domestic Violence, 2018 defines the "Court" as being either the District Court or Circuit Court. The vast majority of applications for Barring Orders or Safety Orders are made in the District Court. A small number of applications are made in the Circuit Court in the context of Judicial Separation or Divorce proceedings. A stand-alone application can also be made in the Circuit Court by way of a Domestic Violence Civil Bill. Further, the High Court can hear applications without a statutory basis as a court of full original jurisdiction. INITIATING DOCUMENTS UNDER THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT 2018 Applications under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, are initiated in the District Court by way of a summons. See Order 59 Rule 2, District Court Rules. In the Circuit Court, if there are proceedings under the Family Law Act 1995, the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 or other family law legislation, a Notice of Motion and Grounding Affidavit seeking relief under the Domestic Violence Act 2018 can be issued.

Stafford Rice at paragraph 23 (1)-(14): [emphasis added] The terms of Order 28 and the authorities on it suggest the following: (1) The power of amendment is a broad one. That is evident from the terms of Order 28 Rule 1 itself, which provides that the Court may allow either party "to alter or amend his indorsement or pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just". (2) In principle, any claim, cause of action or defence that could have been pleaded initio can be added by way of amendment, even if that has the effect of materially - even radically - altering the nature and/or scope of the existing proceedings: see (inter alia) Wolfe Wolfe [2001] 1 313, per Herbert at 135; Shell & Ireland Ltd McGrath [2006] IEHC 99, [2006] 2 ILRM 299, per Laffoy at 311 and Rossmore Properties Limited , at para 19.6.'),

(3) Order 28, Rule 1 is "intended to be a liberal rule" (Croke Waterford Crystal Ltd [2004] IESC 97, [2005] 2 383, per Geoghegan at para 36). Again, that is evident from its express terms, providing as it does that "[a]ll such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties" (my emphasis). (4) The requirement that the amendment is necessary for the purpose of determining "the real questions in controversy between the parties" - the language used in Order 28, Rule 1 - "simply means that the amendment must raise or relate to an issue between the parties arising from the subject matter of the proceedings": Delany & McGrath on Civil Procedure 2018) (para 5-200).

(6) Where a party seeks to rely on prejudice as a basis for resisting an amendment, they must be able to identify some prejudice that stems "from the fact of the belated alteration in the pleadings rather than the presence (if allowed) of the amendment itself" (per Clarke in Woori Bank and Hanvit LSP Finance Ltd KDB Ireland Limited [2006] IEHC 156, para 3.2) (7) Prejudice can arise in different ways. It may be substantive, in the sense that, by virtue of the fact that the amended plea was not made in the proceedings as originally constituted, the other party is or may be disadvantaged in answering that plea. Delany & McGrath on Civil Procedure identifies as "obvious examples" of this category of prejudice a situation where a material witness has died or is unavailable or where other evidence has been lost (para 5-217).'),

Historically, it may have been thought that this form of prejudice can be adequately addressed by the making of an appropriate order for costs.

It is on that basis that a court hearing a joinder application will normally leave any limitation issue over for later determination and it is only where the limitation issue is so clear that joinder would be "futile" that joinder should be refused: see the discussion in my judgment in Cawley Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council [2021] IECA 266] where a new claim is added by way of amendment of existing proceedings pursuant to Order 28, that claim is deemed to have been made from the date of the commencement of the proceedings: Mangan Murphy [2006] IEHC 317, at pages 4-5.

It is not necessary for a defendant to establish as a matter of probability that the new claim is statute-barred: a real possibility that the claim is barred will suffice: see, e.g., Mangan Murphy at page 6 (it is "clear that there is a possibility that allowing the amendment would cause prejudice to the defendants by excluding them from reliance upon the Statute of Limitations") and Smyth Tunney [2009] IESC 5, [2009] 3 322, per Finnegan at para 30 (the "Statute of Limitations may well have run and the defendants would be prejudiced by the amendments sought as to additional publication") (11) However, that rule is not an absolute one and ought not to be applied overly rigidly. Where a plaintiff seeks to amend their pleadings to add a new cause of action arising out of "the same facts or substantially the same facts" as have already been pleaded, the amendment may be permitted: Krops, per Keane at 121.

In such circumstances - neatly illustrated by the facts of Krops permitting a new claim to be made by way of amendment causes no material prejudice to the defendant because they are already on notice of a claim(s) arising from the same facts, which they will have had an opportunity to investigate. The new claim cannot therefore be characterised as a "stale claim" or one which unfairly re-opens a past transaction(s) which the defendant might otherwise have legitimately regarded as closed. (12) There is some suggestion in the authorities that the power of the High Court under Order 28 to permit an amendment "on such terms as may be just" would allow the court to permit a new claim to be added by way of amendment expressly on terms that the amendment will take effect only from the date of the amendment order. The judgment of Birmingham in Rossmore Properties Limited can be read as indicating that he intended that the order made by him in that case should have that effect.

It is essential that the mandatory order is framed precisely so that the respondent knows exactly what is required of him. This requirement is more than purely a matter of form and if the order sought by the applicant is imprecise the court may refuse to grant the order. Thus, in Bula Ltd Tara Mines Limited (No. 2) [1987] 95 the court declined to make the order sought because the judge determined that the obligation was insufficiently certain to enable the respondents to understand their obligations and to enable the court to determine whether or not they were complying.

This, by necessity, requires an examination of the applicant''s case. It will be recalled that in Campus Oil the Supreme Court stated that such an examination should not be conducted. In Campus Oil the court did, however, go on to state that an interlocutory order granting mandatory relief would only be granted in exceptional cases.

It is, therefore, hardly surprising that, in such cases, where the result of the interlocutory application will either completely, or significantly, decide the case, the courts have felt it necessary to impose a higher standard before an injunction can be granted (normally the Maha Lingam standard). That variation from the pure Campus Oil test can be seen as nonetheless still coming within the general principle of attempting to fashion an order which runs the least risk of injustice for if the grant or refusal of an interlocutory order will go a long way towards deciding the case then the risk of an injustice is even greater and the court requires a greater degree of assurance before intervening.

Such orders may be obtained either prior to trial or after trial prior to any judgment obtained being executed. Mareva injunctions are by their nature interlocutory and because they are used most commonly where there is a threat of removal or dissipation, the application is almost always made parte with a fixed return date at which the respondent may argue for discharge or variation. The freezing of assets is, on any analysis, a draconian step and the courts are therefore careful to ensure that such an order is granted only in an appropriate case and on appropriate terms. The return date for the inter partes hearing is invariably short to enable the respondent to put speedily his side of the case either with regard to discharge or, commonly, variation of the terms. Unlike normal injunctions where final injunctive relief is sought at trial a Mareva order is in essence ancillary to the relief being sought, namely the satisfaction of a judgment against the respondent.

In contrast, litigation privilege covers communications between (a) a lawyer and a client (such as instructions), communications between a client and a third party, and communications between a lawyer and third party (typically, a barrister or expert witness) in preparation of contemplated litigation. LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE The rationale for legal advice privilege was best expressed by Knight-Bruce in Pearse Pearse (1846) 1 & 12 at 28-29: Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much. And surely the meanness and mischief of prying into one''s confidential relations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness and suspicion, and fear into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.'),

Thus, the logic is that legal advice privilege thereby serves the administration of justice. As Finlay remarked in Smurfit Paribas Bank AAB Export Finance Ltd in justifying the privilege: Where a person seeks or obtains legal advice there are good reasons to believe that he necessarily enters the arena of potential litigation. In order to establish a legal advice privilege, it is necessary to show that the document or information sought to be disclosed consists of a confidential communication made in the course of a professional relationship for the purposes of giving or receiving legal advice.

As Finlay stated: There are many tasks carried out by a lawyer for his client and properly within the legal sphere, other than the giving of advice, which could not be said to contain any real relationship within the area of potential litigation. For such communications there does not appear to me to be any sufficient public interest or feature of the common good to be secured or protected which could justify an exemption from disclosure. Kelly in Miley Flood [2001] ILRM 489 extracted from Smurfit the principle that a communication only attracts privilege if it seeks or obtains legal advice. In Miley he rejected the contention that privilege could be claimed in respect of the identity of a client, as that was a mere collateral fact unconnected with the provision of legal advice. Similarly, it is arguable that the address of a client and details of when a lawyer met a client would lack privilege on the basis of their being collateral facts.

Such a distinction is very difficult to discern, however. Virtually all cases of legal assistance, including straightforward leases and wills, engender some degree of pre-emptive consideration of the possibility of future dispute and litigation. The effect of introducing an unclear distinction within the legal professional privilege may be to undermine the public interest served by the privilege, namely the preservation of lawyer-client candour unstrained by the threat of publicity, and to invite more frequent challenge to documentation claimed to be privileged as legal. It might be noted that in Gallagher Stanley & National Maternity Hospital [1998] 2 267 the Supreme Court referred to legal professional privilege attaching to "confidential communications passing between lawyer and client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance" or in contemplation of litigation.

It is essential that litigation should be reasonably apprehended (see Gallagher Stanley & National Maternity Hospital [1998] 2 267). The problem in this area is where documents were formulated with mixed motives (i.e. a litigious purpose and a non-litigious purpose).

Although litigation might have been on her mind, he thought that she was likely to have been primarily motivated by her management duties. O''Flaherty endorsed the dominant purpose test. In deciding that legal professional privilege did not attach to the statements, he was influenced by the basis of the privilege and the fact that a witness statement was distinct from legal advice and instruction. He said that the purpose of the privilege: is to aid the administration of justice, not to impede it.

Fraud is not just confined to criminal cases but encompasses civil cases such as the tort of deceit, fraudulent breach of trust, conspiracy, trickery and sham contrivances.

In Murphy Kirwan, the Supreme Court was divided on the level of proof required to substantiate an allegation of malicious prosecution raised by the Defendants in an attempt to defeat the Plaintiff''s claim to legal professional privilege. Finlay in his majority judgment, was of the view that the party seeking disclosure should establish that his allegation is ''plausible or viable'' whilst Egan dissenting, considered that here must be some prima facie evidence that the allegation has a foundation in fact." It is arguable that Egan J''s test is stronger in that it requires an element of persuasive evidence sufficient to justify a reasonable inference in favour of the claim of disclosure. Privilege is not necessarily lost, however, if the lawyer warns the client that unless he acts in a certain way, he will be liable to prosecution, as was held in Butler Board of Trade [1971] 680.

Phipson (Phipson on Evidence Sweet & Maxwell, 1990) at 527) has long been of the view that English law unnecessarily protects against the loss of privilege in this way, and that where a party reveals part of his hand privilege should be lost extensively.

PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS DISCLOSED BY INADVERTENCE OR MISCONDUCT The traditional view was that disclosure of privileged communications through inadvertence or misconduct resulted in the loss of that privilege and evidence of the communications was admissible. In Calcraft Guest [1898] 1 759 witnesses who had copied original privileged documents, accidentally left in their possession, were permitted to prove their contents. The Court of Appeal reasoned that this would be permissible even if the documents had fallen into another''s hands by unlawful or improper means - an approach that Healy comments "instantly appears incompatible with the preference in Ireland for balancing constitutional rights and considerations of public interest". Calcraft was followed in a criminal context in Tompkins (1977) 67 App Rep 181 with respect to handwritten notes discovered on the floor of the court by opposing counsel and in which the accused revealed incriminating information. However, there is authority to the effect that the court has power to grant an injunction if the other party has either procured inspection of the relevant documents by fraud or on inspection realised that he has been permitted to see the documents only by reason of an obvious mistake.

In English and American Insurance Ltd. Herbert Smith & [1988] FSR 232 the privileged documents were mistakenly rerouted with a batch of papers by a law clerk to the opponent''s solicitors. Although the court did not formally overrule Calcraft, Brown-Wilkinson noted other cases of similar circumstances where the privilege had been enforced, and he found for the Plaintiffs, observing that it would be: most undesirable if the security which is the basis of that freedom [of speech between lawyer and client] were to be prejudiced by mischances which are of everyday occurrence leading to documents which have escaped being used by the other side.

INTERACTION BETWEEN LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE AND PUBLIC INTEREST PRIVILEGE In Corbett DPP [1999] 2 179 it was recognised that in many cases the claim by a body or agent of the State to public interest privilege is coterminous with a claim to legal professional privilege, where the communications were for the purposes of legal advice or contemplated litigation.

The communication must be made in furtherance of the settlement of the dispute. Thus, in Flanagan Ray-Ger Ltd. (Unreported, High Court, April 1983) Costello concluded that the privilege did not apply because the communication was not an offer to settle but a statement as to the rights of the Plaintiff and her husband in relation to certain property.

The court is not precluded from considering and acting upon such communications in the context of submissions that the Defendant induced the claimant to believe that a settlement would be reached and that there was no necessity to institute proceedings within the relevant limitation period. Thus, the Irish courts engage in a balancing exercise based on policy and the public interest in determining whether to sanction the application of the privilege or not. The privilege is the joint privilege of the parties and if negotiations fail a privileged communication may only be disclosed to the court with the consent of each of the parties. However, if negotiation succeeds the fact of compromise is admissible. Further, without prejudice communications are admissible if a question arises as to whether the negotiations led to an agreement and as to what was actually agreed between the parties and whether that gives rise to an estoppel.

It is necessary to determine to what extent the documents may advance the Plaintiff''s case or damage the Defendant''s case or fairly lead to an enquiry which may have either of those consequences (see Breathnach Ireland (No. 3) [1993] 2 448). A further important consideration is whether the litigant is seeking to vindicate a constitutional right. Thus, a document may be deemed to be privileged in order to protect a constitutional right such as the right to life (see Burke Central Independent Television [1994] 2 61). Finally, where the innocence of a person is at stake there is an overriding public interest in ensuring that an innocent person is not convicted. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE There are four main exceptions to disclosure in this context and these are set out separately below: National Security A document will ordinarily not be disclosed where it affects the vital interests of the State. The courts determine what national security is and just because a document is unquestionably confidential or sensitive it does not follow that it will not be disclosed (see Gormley Ireland [1993] 2 75).'),

(iii) Proper Functioning of the Public Service The courts will weigh the public interest in the proper functioning of the public service against the public interest in the disclosure. The public service extends beyond central government to embrace local authorities and bodies which perform statutory functions in the public interest such as the Garda Síochána Complaints Board or a tribunal but does not include the Law Society. The argument for the privilege is to foster candour in the public service and that the free and candid communications between persons in the public service would be chilled if there were no privilege.

Keane confirmed this view in Breathnach Ireland [1993] 2 448 where the courts were required to weigh the public interest in the proper administration of justice against the public interest in the prevention and prosecution of crime. It was held that only where the former outweighed the latter that an inspection should be undertaken or disclosure ordered.

In Attorney General Hamilton (No. 2) [1993] 2 277 the Supreme Court considered whether parliamentary privilege is lost when a member outside the Dáil or Seanad repeats the allegation or information, such as before a tribunal of inquiry. The High Court had decided that since parliamentary privilege is absolute it should be narrowly construed, and upon this basis the privilege did not implicitly extend to ''statements'' repeated by the member outside the Oireachtas or tendered as evidence before a tribunal of inquiry. The Supreme Court disagreed and found that the true construction of Articles 15.12 and 15.13 was that any utterance first made in either House of the Oireachtas, wheresoever published, remains privileged in the context of any legal proceedings. Thus, the privilege was not lost upon "factually similar" repetition of the information by the member outside the Oireachtas, and the source of the information remained confidential.'),

It was appropriate then that the common law principles governing this question of privilege are developed in Ireland "in harmony with the national spirit" and the "special position" afforded by the Constitution to the Roman Catholic Church. In developing a new basis for the privilege, Gavan Duffy approved four criteria favoured by Wigmore for the general purpose of conferring privilege upon communications by virtue of the confidential nature of the relationship between the communicants. According to these criteria, privilege may be established where the court is satisfied that: (1) the communication was confidential; (2) confidentiality is essential to the satisfactory maintenance of the relationship; (3) the relationship is one the community deems necessary to foster; and (4) the likely harm caused by mandatory disclosure outweighs the benefit to be gained in the instant case.'),

This conclusion might appear doubtful in the light of subsequent developments whereby the court weighs the application of a privilege against the public interest and justice in ordering disclosure. Privilege may not exist where confidentiality of relationship and exchange is absent. In Forristal Forristal (1966) 100 ILTR 182 Deale noted that Gavan Duffy had confined his ruling in Cook to private exchanges between a priest and his parishioner.

The judge specified that the privilege belonged to both spouses and could only be waived by both. CONFIDENTIALITY It is important to stress that just because a confidential relationship exists does not mean that the courts will not order disclosure. The courts have rejected claims of privilege in respect of a host of other erstwhile confidential communications such as communications passing between doctor and patient, a banker and a customer or an accountant and a client to name a few.

There is however a growing recognition by the judiciary that discovery should not be granted where its use might become oppressive and should therefore only be granted where it is necessary for the fair disposal of the case. A basic point to be appreciated is that discovery of documents is merely a list of documents. Inspection, which will be dealt with later in the course, entitles the party in question to inspect (to actually see) the documents and, if necessary, to take copies thereof. The entitlement to inspection is subject to a possible argument that the document is privileged.

Any system of disclosure should have as a broad rationale the just and efficient disposal of litigation. Matthews and Malik, Disclosure (Sweet and Maxwell, at 4.

Discovery can be expensive and burdensome, and the courts are increasingly alert to the dangers of oppressive disclosure.

The amendment to the rule allows the Court to direct discovery of documents that are or have been in the party''s "possession, power or procurement". Possession does not mean solely actual possession but includes documents within the power of procurement of a party (see Yates Ciba Geigy Agro Limited (Unreported, High Court, April 1986).

Norwich Pharmacol owned the patent to a chemical used for immunising poultry. Statistics published by the Customs and Excise Commissioners revealed that the number of importations of the chemical was higher than those bought in by Norwich. Norwich Pharmacol was unable to take direct steps to protect their patent, so they brought proceedings against the Commissioners to compel them to disclose the identities of the other importers. It was held that although Norwich Pharmacol had no substantive cause of action against the Commissioners, the Commissioners had facilitated the wrongdoing of the importers and were ordered to disclose their identities. Since the Norwich Pharmacol case, the rule has been extended. For example, an order was made against a settlor to disclose to potential beneficiaries the names and addresses of trustees so that the potential beneficiaries could communicate with them with a view to being considered for the distribution of trust property. The order was made even though the trustees were not accused or suspected of any wrongdoing. It is, however, clear that such an order is a matter of sparing discretion. In England and Wales, the courts have conceptualised a Norwich Pharmacol order as an equitable remedy where the courts have discretion as to whether to grant it and which is subject to four possible defences: 1.

The essence of the distinction is that discovery in judicial review can rarely be brought as the facts rarely are a matter of relevant dispute in a judicial review application. In Sheehy and McAuley The Government of Ireland (Unreported, High Court, July 2002) the judge endorsed the dictum of Lord Diplock in Reilly Mackman, [1983] 2 237 that: The facts...can seldom be a matter of relevant dispute upon an application for judicial review. As a qualifier to the above in Ayaya Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Unreported, High Court, May 2003), Finlay Geoghegan indicated that: It is however inherent in the nature of judicial review that the necessity for discovery will be more difficult to establish than in plenary proceedings.

The factor of confidence however militates against general orders for discovery and does impose upon the tribunal the duty of satisfying itself, by inspection if need be that justice requires disclosure.

Those words direct attention to the question whether inspection is necessary for the fair determination of the matter, whether by trial or otherwise. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that one party does not enjoy an unfair advantage or suffer an unfair disadvantage in the litigation as a result of a document not being produced for inspection. It is, think, of no importance that a party is curious about the contents of a document or would like to know the contents of it if he suffers no litigious disadvantage by not seeing it and would gain no litigious advantage by seeing it.

If the tribunal is satisfied that it is necessary to order certain documents to be disclosed and inspected in order fairly to dispose of the proceedings then, in my opinion, the law requires that such an order should be made; and the fact that the documents are confidential is irrelevant. The law has always recognised that it is of the greatest importance from the point of view of public policy that proceedings in the courts or before tribunals shall be fairly disposed of. This, no doubt, is why the law has never accorded privilege against discovery and inspection to confidential documents, which are necessary for fairly disposing of the proceedings.

Goodbody Ltd Clyde Shipping Company Limited, (Unreported, Supreme Court, May 1967), where he indicated that the purpose of interrogatories is to sustain the Plaintiff''s case as well as to destroy that of the Defendant and that interrogatories need not be confined to facts directly in issue but may extend to any facts the existence or non-existence of which is relevant to the fact(s) directly in issue and that interrogatories need not be conclusive on the question in issue but should have some bearing and might form a step in establishing liability. Walsh J''s test is a high watermark of liberalism in this context and was retreated upon somewhat by subsequent high courts. For example, in Mercantile Credit Corporation of Ireland Heelan [1994] 2 105 Costello indicated that actions are in principle to be heard on oral evidence and the use of evidence on affidavit given in reply to interrogatories is an exception which must be justified by some special exigency which in the interests of justice requires the exception to be allowed.

Fanning, as the facts themselves become evidence once replies are furnished to interrogatories. Above all one is not entitled to fish. O''Sullivan J''s analysis merits quotation: The distinction between "... what is mere evidence of the facts in dispute..." on the one hand, and on the other "... the facts themselves..." is a difficult one because the facts themselves become evidence once replies are furnished to interrogatories. The line between what is and is not permissible is even more difficult to lay down in light of the right to interrogate not only in relation to the facts directly in issue but in relation to any facts "the existence or non-existence of which is relevant to the existence or non-existence of the facts directly in issue."

In McCole Blood Transfusion Service Board (Unreported, High Court, June 1996) the court, echoing Costello J''s judgment in the Mercantile case, emphasised the importance of cross examination at trial for eliciting information and indicated that interrogatories had to be essential for preparation of the case such that if left to cross examination the party would be irremediably prejudiced. In Quilligan Sugrue (Unreported, High Court, February 1984) the court stated: No doubt in many running down cases it might be right not to allow interrogatories because they are not "necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs as where the Plaintiff can call witnesses who saw the accident.'),

In this regard, have in mind the use of interrogatories. In the Commercial List, interrogatories may be delivered as of right.

Interrogatories need no longer be framed in an archaic form by posing questions in the negative. They can ask direct questions. have seen many cases in this division of the court where a large reduction in discovery and considerable shortening of trial time was achieved by the answering of, by times, in excess of a hundred interrogatories. Given the easy availability of interrogatories in the Commercial List, it is important that practitioners utilise that facility. When seeking to obtain information from their opponents, the first port of call ought not to be requests for discovery if it is probable that the information which is being sought is capable of being elicited by an adroit use of interrogatories. Whilst the comments of Kelly were made in the context of Commercial Court proceeding his preference to negate the necessity for wide ranging discovery and his practical consideration on the interplay between interrogatories and discovery is certainly of relevance and may indeed influence the future jurisprudence in this area.'),

The plaintiff, of which the second defendant had at one time been company secretary, claimed that the defendants were diverting for their own use e-mails containing confidential information intended for the plaintiff. The defendants sought and obtained in the High Court security for costs from the plaintiff pursuant to section 390 of the Companies Act 1963. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, acknowledging that it might not be in a financial position to meet the costs of the action if unsuccessful, but claiming that the court should exercise its discretion to refuse the application for security for costs for two principal reasons. First, the plaintiff contended that the defendants had not demonstrated a prima facie defence and, secondly, the plaintiff claimed that there were special circumstances - namely the defendants'' delay of one year in seeking security for costs which disentitled the defendants to the relief sought. The Supreme Court (Geoghegan, Fennelly and Kearns allowing the appeal, held that an applicant for an order for security for costs under section 390 of the Companies Act 1963 must establish a prima facie defence to the plaintiff''s claim.'),

The defendants'' actions in allowing the case to proceed for one year before seeking security for costs, while aware of the plaintiff''s financial weakness, constituted special circumstances disentitling them to the order sought. The courts do consider whether there is an individual Co-Plaintiff within the jurisdiction to whom the Defendant may look for the payment of costs but, although some significance is attached to this fact, uncertainty surrounds the question of its relative importance (see Delany and McGrath on Civil Procedure (Round Hall, chapter 13)., In the context of security for costs for an appeal it is again a matter of discretion. Attention is given as to whether there is an arguable case (see Peppard & Ltd Bogoff [1962] 180).

For example, judgment may be entered in default of defence or on an application for summary judgment. Alternatively, the action or actions may be struck out for want of prosecution or as a result of an abuse of process or simply discontinued. In most cases however the reason that an action never reaches trial is because the parties negotiate a settlement of the dispute. The reasons why any party may wish to settle their dispute are varied, however most often the reason is one of costs. The costs of a trial depend on a number of criteria including the expected length, complexity, the number of Counsel to be instructed and the fees of any experts who may be required to attend. Since the costs of running a trial often far exceed the costs of all the interim proceedings involved in the dispute prior to trial, most parties will attempt settlement prior to the trial.

It is imperative therefore that some manner of control is exercised over such bodies to ensure that their functions are carried out in accordance with law. This concept of the "rule of law" underpins Irish administrative law. It encompasses four key principles. First, that every executive or administrative act that affects legal rights or interests must have legal justification. Secondly every entity, including the government and its servants, are subject to the law. Thirdly, the legality of executive or administrative acts is to be determined by judges who are independent of the government and finally, that the law should be public and precise and its operation predictable. In accordance with the rule of law, the High Court exercises supervisory jurisdiction over a range of administrative bodies and tribunals (as well as the lower courts) through the procedure of judicial review.'),

In a judicial review application, a court will review matters such as whether the proper procedures were applied in reaching the decision at first instance, or whether the original decision-maker had proper jurisdiction, or whether he applied the correct legal principles in making the decision that is being challenged. It varies fundamentally from a full appeal where the decision itself can be questioned on the merits. When the High Court reviews administrative law decisions, it is concerned with the legality of the decision, not necessarily its merits. Thus, it cannot strike down a decision simply because it does not like it or because it would prefer an alternative conclusion. The High Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the administrative body whose decision is being challenged. The principles applicable to judicial review of administrative decisions have been described as follows in State (Abenglen Properties Ltd.) Dublin Corporation [1984] 381 at 392. From this emergence three centuries ago of the means by which the Court of King''s Bench controlled the judicial process of lower courts, the remedy of certiorari has been developed and extended to reach far beyond the mere control of judicial process in courts as such.'),

Thus, if a decision purely affects the rights of private parties and does not have a public dimension, then the public law remedy of judicial review will not lie. In determining whether a decision has a public element, the court will look at the source of the power being invoked and the nature of the power. While the courts in the past have focussed on the source of the power, it seems it is now the nature of the power exercised that is the most important factor.

In Gordon DPP [2002] 2 369 (which is discussed more fully below), the Supreme Court referred to the leave requirement as a "low threshold" and a "light burden." In certain specific cases, such as planning or immigration matters, statute imposes a more onerous obligation on an applicant to show "substantial grounds" for the application at the leave stage.

In terms of evidence, the requirement for a prima facie case is regarded as that which "if not balanced or outweighed by other evidence, will suffice to establish a particular contention"; Halsbury''s Law of England (5 edition) volume 11, paragraph 767. In terms of law, the test is no different: it is a point of law which if not balanced or outweighed by other principles will suffice to establish the contention.

A good point does not gain force by repetition. In fact, the contrary is true. What is required is simply a succinct statement of the grounds. It is open to an applicant to furnish particulars of each ground so as to ensure that the court will be aware of the precise details of the case. What is not required, however, is that each ground should be reformulated in a number of different ways.

Do you want to create a competitive, co-operative or collaborative atmosphere in the negotiation? What will you do to achieve this?

Equally a long period of time between accrual of a cause of action and the trial is likely to have a detrimental effect on the memory of witnesses with the result that a just and efficient outcome is prejudiced.'),

This is further illustrated in relation to appropriation of debts. Thus where, for example, a Defendant owes to the Plaintiff two separate debts one of which is statute barred and the other which is not and pays some of the money due without specifically stating that it is paid in satisfaction of the non statute-barred debt, the Plaintiff is entitled to appropriate that money (subject to Section 69 (2) of the Act) in satisfaction of the statute-barred debt and to pursue the debt which is within the limitation period by way of action. The expiry of the limitation period does not extinguish the debt merely the Plaintiff''s means to recover it by way of court action.

[111]In my view, time begins to run from the date of manifestation of damage, which means it runs from the time that the damage was capable of being discovered and capable of being proved by the plaintiff. This was the conclusion reached in respect of personal injuries claims in Hegarty O''Loughran [1990] 1 I.R. 148. The case law since then is ambiguous as to whether such a commencement date should or indeed has been transposed to property damage claims.

In Cantrell AIB [2020] IESC 71 (a case which concerned the negligent mis-selling of a financial product), the Supreme Court held that in such claims the limitation period only begins to run when the risk renders the product less valuable. The Court concluded (at paragraph 132) that damage for the accrual of a cause of action must "bear a close relationship to the layperson''s understanding of that term.

This fact alone does not, of course, require the Court to make an order under sub-section (5).

A summons is a document served by the Plaintiff on the Defendant informing him that the Plaintiff has a claim against him and requiring him to enter an appearance to answer that claim. The summons warns the Defendant that, should he fail to enter an appearance, the Plaintiff may proceed to seek judgment in his absence. There are four types of originating summonses: 1. Plenary summons This is the most common type of summons and is used in all cases which will require further pleadings and oral evidence, unless otherwise provided for in the Rules of the Superior Courts. A plenary summons is followed by a further document from the Plaintiff, called a statement of claim, in which he sets out his claim in more detail. The Defendant will respond to the summons and statement of claim with a defence. Plenary summonses, statements of claim and defences are dealt with in more detail below. 2. Summary summons Order 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts specifies the classes of claims which may be commenced by summary summons. The most common of these are: (a) cases where the Plaintiff seeks only to recover a debt or liquidated sum of money (i.e.'),

Summary proceedings (i.e. those commenced by summary summons) are intended to be dealt with more expeditiously than plenary proceedings (i.e. those commenced by plenary summons). Summary proceedings are appropriate only where it will be unnecessary for the court to hear oral evidence because there are essentially no questions of fact at issue between the parties, or where there is no defence open to the Defendant. An example of this is where the Plaintiff is a bank seeking recovery of a loan which has not been repaid by the Defendant. There is no question of fact to be determined or defence open to the Defendant. The bank simply uses summary proceedings as a mechanism of enforcing a debt which the Defendant has failed to discharge. There is a specific procedure used in summary proceedings set out in Order 37 of the Rules of the Superior Courts. This procedure will be dealt with at a later stage in the manual.'),

Special summons This type of summons is used for those types of proceedings specified in Order 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts and elsewhere in legislation. Like summary summons procedure, special summons procedure is intended as an expeditious procedure without further pleadings or oral evidence. Order 38 of the Rules of the Superior Courts sets out the specific procedure for the hearing of proceedings commenced by special summons. The following are some common examples of cases which may be initiated by special summons: (a) administration of the estate of a deceased person or the determination of any question affecting the rights of anyone claiming to be entitled to a share of such estate - e.g. a claim under 117 of the Succession Act 1965 by the children of a deceased person to have proper provision made for them out of the estate; certain applications made by mortgagors or mortgagees; judicial separation and divorce (see Order 70A). 4.

TIME LIMITS FOR DELIVERY OF A STATEMENT OF CLAIM Order 20 Rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides that the Plaintiff may deliver his statement of claim together with the plenary summons or at any time within 8 weeks from the date of service of the summons. As will be seen subsequently, a Defendant responds to a plenary summons by entering an appearance in the Central Office. Order 20 Rule 3 provides that, where the Defendant enters an appearance and gives notice in writing that he requires a statement of claim from the Plaintiff, the statement of claim must be delivered within 8 weeks from the receipt of such notice.

The same rules do not necessarily apply in other forms of drafting (e.g. drafting affidavits - see separate section on affidavits). PLEADINGS SHOULD CONTAIN THE MATERIAL FACTS ON WHICH THE PARTY RELIES As noted above, the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues between the parties. This is achieved by pleading the facts upon which the claim or defence is based. The facts, as pleaded, should reveal the legal cause of action or defence asserted by the party in question. The Plaintiff cannot simply allege, for example, that the Defendant was negligent. He must show how the Defendant was negligent, by reference to the facts of the case. Generally speaking, therefore, it is said that pleadings should contain facts, not law. However, in certain instances it is appropriate to refer to specific legal principles in the pleadings. Order 19 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides the following: "Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved ..."

For example, if the Plaintiff seeks damages for negligence on the part of the Defendant, he must plead facts which, if proved, would establish the requisite elements of the tort - i.e. that the Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff, that the Defendant has failed to meet the required standard of care and that the Plaintiff has thereby suffered some loss or damage. Failing to plead each of the essential element of the claim and the material facts of such elements can have significant consequences at the trial of the action. It may ultimately result in the court refusing to allow evidence to be called on a specific unpleaded but material fact. Although it is available to bring an application to amend the pleadings this can lead to significant delay and an increase in the legal costs. The case Wildgust Bank of Ireland [2001] 1 ILRM 24 dealt with an application to amend pleadings during the course of trial. At the trial of the action the Plaintiff sought to call evidence to establish a claim based on negligent misstatement.

The Regulation goes on to identify areas of special jurisdiction in which persons domiciled in a member state may be sued in the courts of another member state. The following are a few common examples of such circumstances that are contained in the Regulation: 1.'),

This is provided for in Order 11A Rule 8 where a defendant may enter an appearance in Form No. 6 in Appendix A, Part Defendant outside the jurisdiction: For cases that come within Order 11, Rule 10 of that Order provides that a defendant wishing to enter an appearance to contest the jurisdiction of the court, they may do so by entering an appearance in Form No. 10 in Appendix A, Part [See also Order 11A, Rule 3; Order Rule 3.] Often counsel will not be briefed until after an Appearance has been entered, at which stage it may be too late to contest jurisdiction or object to the manner of service. Where counsel is briefed before an Appearance has been entered, it is important to consider carefully whether the manner of service or the court''s jurisdiction is open to challenge. If so, the solicitor should be advised not to enter an Appearance pending an application to challenge.'),

Order 21, Rule 23 (which came into operation on October 2016 254/2016) and does not apply to Personal Injuries actions) provides that where a Defendant intends to offer expert evidence on any matter arising only in connection with a counterclaim, at the trial, the counterclaim shall disclose that intention and state succinctly the field of expertise concerned and the matters on which expert evidence is intended to be offered.'),

CONSIDER THE MATERIAL FACTS PLEADED IN THE CLAIM The burden of proof in civil litigation is generally on the Plaintiff - i.e. the party making a claim against the other party. Therefore, it is for the Plaintiff to prove each and every element of his claim against the Defendant. In response to the document initiating a claim, the Defendant will have an opportunity to set out his Defence. In so doing, it is vital that he denies every aspect of the Plaintiff''s claim, as pleaded, which he is not willing to admit. Once the Defendant has denied an element of the Plaintiff''s claim, that element becomes an issue in the case and must be proved by the Plaintiff if he is to succeed. On the other hand, any element of the Plaintiff''s claim admitted or not expressly denied by the Defendant is accepted by the court as if it had been proved.'),

He must refer specifically to each and every material allegation, pleaded by the Plaintiff, which he denies.

In most cases, the main reasons for bringing a motion in default of pleadings are (a) to move the case along and to penalise the other side by an order of costs. For example, in the overwhelming majority of motions for judgment in default of appearance, the court will extend the time for entry of an appearance or the Defendant will already have entered an appearance, albeit outside the prescribed time limit.

The Plaintiff will usually be awarded the costs of the application - meaning that the Defendant will have to pay the fees of the Plaintiff''s solicitor and counsel - because the Defendant has defaulted in his obligations under the rules of court.

For example, the motion may seek to set aside the judgment on the basis that the Defendant has a bona fide defence to the Plaintiff''s claim or that there was some procedural irregularity in the judgment granted. The motion should be grounded on an affidavit setting out in more detail the merits of the defence to the Plaintiff''s claim and explaining the delay in entering an appearance or delivering a defence.

A party is entitled to know the broad outline of what is going to be said at trial by his opponent. 3. A party is not entitled to matters of evidence, but only to the material facts upon which his opponent''s claim is based. 4. A party is not entitled to seek documents from his opponent in a notice for particulars. 5. The particulars sought and furnished must relate to the pleadings. Despite the foregoing, in practice it is not uncommon for a party to seek proof of special damages (e.g. receipts and vouchers) as "further and better particulars".

Having considered each of the particulars Hogan disallowed the vast majority of the particulars sought. The judgment is instructive of a different attitude towards particulars. The judge concluded by commenting that: ...it is difficult to avoid the impression that the very fact that the particulars sought here are representative of current practice and that many of the requests in this and similar cases are either irrelevant or not permissible in law as particulars are nonetheless steadfastly advanced shows that many pleaders have simply gone astray in their enthusiasm to interrogate every possible detail of their opponent''s claim.
