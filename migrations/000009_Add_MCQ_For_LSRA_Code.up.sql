The prosecution must of course have in court the witness whose names are on the back of the indictment, but there is a wide discretion in the prosecution whether they should call them, either calling and examining them, or calling and tendering them for crossexamination. The prosecution do not, of course, put forward every witness as a witness of truth, but where the witness''s 28 evidence is capable of belief, then it is their duty, well recognised, that he should be called, even though the evidence that he is going to give is inconsistent with the case sought to be proved.

If the prosecution appears to be exercising that discretion improperly, it is open to the judge of trial to interfere and in his discretion in turn to invite the prosecution to call a particular witness, and if they refuse there is the ultimate sanction in the judge himself calling the witness."
